This directory contains the raw data used in my project, specifically the Iris dataset introduced by Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper titled "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems." The dataset is widely used for classification tasks in machine learning and statistics.

Contents
- iris.csv: The raw data file containing the Iris dataset. This file includes measurements of iris flowers and their species classification.
- run 01_scripts/1_save_iris_data.R to regenerate the raw data

Dataset Overview
- The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples from three species of iris flowers (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica). Each sample includes four features (measurements) and a label (species).
- Please see the DATA_DICTIONARY.md for description of the variables.
