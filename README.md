# Project for The Canadian Institute of Ecology and Evolution Living Data Project's Reproducibility Course

#### Description: 
This repository contains my course project for The Living Data Project's Productivity and Reproducibility in Ecology and Evolution course. I am creating an immaginative project that investigates environmental drivers of functional traits using the popular Iris dataset.

#### This repository is organized as follows:
- [00_rawdata](./00_rawdata)
- [01_scripts](./01_scripts)
- [04_manuscript](./04_manuscript)
- [05_preregistration](./05_preregistration)

#### Where do the raw data come from?
- I used the popular Iris dataset from Ronald Fisher's 1936 paper. Please find the citation in my [manuscript](./04_manuscript/rendered/manuscript.pdf)
- Either re-generate data by running [/01_scripts/1_save_iris_data.R](./01_scripts/1_save_iris_data.R) or use data that is supplied in [00_rawdata/iris.csv](./00_rawdata/iris.csv)

#### Generate a manuscript or preregistration
- Run [04_manuscript/manuscript.Rmd](./04_manuscript/manuscript.Rmd) to knit a pdf of my fake manuscript
- Run [05_preregistration/preregistration.Rmd](./05_preregistration/preregistration.Rmd) to knit a pdf of my fake preregistration
