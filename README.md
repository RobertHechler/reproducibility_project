# Project for The Canadian Institute of Ecology and Evolution Living Data Project's Reproducibility Course

#### Description: 
This repository contains my course project for The Living Data Project's Productivity and Reproducibility in Ecology and Evolution course. I am creating an immaginative project using the Iris dataset to practice.

#### This repository is organized as follows:
- 00_raw data
- 01_scripts
- 04_manuscript
- 05_preregistration

#### Where do the raw data come from?
- I used the popular Iris dataset from Ronald Fisher's 1936 paper titled The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems.
- Run 1_save_iris_data.R to save the raw data

#### Generate a manuscript or preregistration
- 04_manuscript/manuscript.Rmd knits a pdf of my fake manuscript
- 05_preregistration/preregistration.Rmd knits a pdf of my fake preregistration
