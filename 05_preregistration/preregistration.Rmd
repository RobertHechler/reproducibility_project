## Project description 
<!-- Verbal description of the effect I am trying to replicate -->

I made up a fake project for the LDP course using the iris dataset. I could, for example, look at how sepal width varies with iris species.

## Data collection

<!-- Have any data been collected for this study already? (Note: "Yes" is not an accepted answer.) -->

**No**, no data have been collected for this study yet.

## Hypothesis

<!-- What's the main question being asked or hypothesis being tested in this study? -->

This is a fake example for the LDP class. I am using the iris dataset and hypothesize that sepal length varies with species

## Dependent variable

<!-- Describe the key dependent variable(s) specifying how they will be measured. -->

Sepal length will be measured in cm using a ruler

## Conditions

<!-- How many and which conditions will participants be assigned to? -->

Conditions include different iris species

## Analyses

<!-- Specify exactly which analyses you will conduct to examine the main question/hypothesis. -->

I will use an anova to compare group means. Doing a glmm could be fun too [@bolker2009]

## Outliers and exclusions

<!-- Describe exactly how outliers will be defined and handled, and your precise rule(s) for excluding observations. -->

I won't remove any outliers

## Sample size

<!-- How many observations will be collected or what will determine sample size? No need to justify decision, but be precise about _exactly_ how the number will be determined. -->

I will measure 150 iris plants per species

## Other
<!-- Anything else you would like to pre-register? (e.g., secondary analyses, variables collected for exploratory purposes, unusual analyses planned?) -->

This is so fun :)

## Study type

This is a fake class project for the Living Data Project's Reproducibility course
