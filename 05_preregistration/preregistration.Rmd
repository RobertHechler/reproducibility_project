<!-- To keep pre-registrations to a reasonable length for readers, we recommend answers fit within a single page .pdf document, roughly 3200 characters. Read more about this here: https://aspredicted.org/messages/why_limits.php -->


## Data collection
<!-- Have any data been collected for this study already? (Note: "Yes" is not an accepted answer.) -->

**No**, no data have been collected for this study yet.


## Hypothesis
<!-- What's the main question being asked or hypothesis being tested in this study? -->

> This is a fake example for the LDP class. I am using the iris dataset and hypothesize that sepal length varies with species


## Dependent variable
<!-- Describe the key dependent variable(s) specifying how they will be measured. -->

> Sepal length will be measured in cm using a ruler 

## Conditions
<!-- How many and which conditions will participants be assigned to? -->

> Conditions include different iris species



## Analyses
<!-- Specify exactly which analyses you will conduct to examine the main question/hypothesis. -->

> I will use an anova to compare group means 


## Outliers and exclusions
<!-- Describe exactly how outliers will be defined and handled, and your precise rule(s) for excluding observations. -->

> I won't remove any outliers

## Sample size
<!-- How many observations will be collected or what will determine sample size? No need to justify decision, but be precise about _exactly_ how the number will be determined. -->

> I will measure 150 iris plants per species


## Other
<!-- Anything else you would like to pre-register? (e.g., secondary analyses, variables collected for exploratory purposes, unusual analyses planned?) -->

> This is so fun :) 

## Study type
Finally. For record keeping purposes, please tell us the type of study you are pre-registering.
