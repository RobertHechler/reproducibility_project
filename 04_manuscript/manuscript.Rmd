## Introduction

This is my fake manuscript using iris dataset. I actually work on fish such as pink salmon (*Oncorhynchus gorbuscha*) but this manuscript is not about salmon. Here I demonstrate the cool skills I learned in class :)

I also learned how to cite papers like this: Biodiversity is rapidly changing [@blowes_geography_2019], and glmms are useful for understanding these changes [@bolker_generalized_2009].

```{r echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
library(knitr)
data <- read.csv("../00_rawdata/iris.csv")
kable(summary(data), align = "lllll", caption = "Summary statistics of the iris dataset") 

```
