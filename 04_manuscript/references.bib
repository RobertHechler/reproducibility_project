	abstract = {The study of environmental DNA (eDNA) has the potential to revolutionize biodiversity science and conservation action by enabling the census of species on a global scale in near real time. To achieve this promise, technical challenges must be resolved. In this review, we explore the main uses of eDNA as well as the complexities introduced by its misuse. Current eDNA methods require refinement and improved calibration and validation along the entire workflow to lessen false positives/negatives. Moreover, there is great need for a better understanding of the “natural history” of eDNA—its origins, state, lifetime, and transportation—and for more detailed insights concerning the physical and ecological limitations of eDNA use. Although eDNA analysis can provide powerful information, particularly in freshwater and marine environments, its impact is likely to be less significant in terrestrial settings. The broad adoption of eDNA tools in conservation will largely depend on addressing current uncertainties in data interpretation.},

	abstract = {Starting in the mid 2000s, a financial asset management company and institutional investors began to invest in timberlands in British Columbia, Canada's most western province. In a period of political economic crisis, investors looked to real assets—“dirt and trees” in the words of one research participant—as a means of accumulating capital through securing access to huge parcels of the most productive and valuable forestland in North America. This article analyses these investments as a socioecological fix for finance capital suggesting that investments in land represent a means for capital and the state to negotiate moments of crisis. The article complicates existing accounts of fixes by demonstrating how the survival of capital in a settler context is fully dependent on an ongoing settler-colonial project of separating Indigenous people from their land base. The article focuses on the explicitly “private” nature of the land under examination and how this is central to the strategies of investors, the state's deregulation of forest policies, and the marginalization of First Nations' claims to land. The article demonstrates that in settler contexts, discussions of fixes need to be much more attentive to the historic and enduring colonial threads woven through investments in land.},

We detail the intensity of industrial logging activities of three forestry companies—Island Timberlands, TimberWest, and Western Forest Products—on private land on Vancouver Island. We draw on 11 years of harvesting volume records from the public British Columbia Harvest Billing System to examine the rate of harvest on private land by the aforementioned companies. The paper maps the harvesting volumes we report in relation to forest land ownership and the boundaries of land grants to demonstrate the enduring settler-colonial character of fee simple forest land and industrial harvesting activities. We argue that neoliberal legislation introduced in 2003 deregulated forestry operations on private lands, facilitating the harvesting regimes we detail. We further suggest that settler-colonial enclosures set in motion by the Esquimalt \& Nanaimo Railway Company land grants starting in 1884 have been foundational to the establishment and management of private forest lands on Vancouver Island and continue to represent barriers for Indigenous communities as they assert their rights and title to private forest land.},

We also engage with the politics of information and legitimation accompanying the financialization of nature to tease out levers for political critique. Finally, we map out a forward-looking agenda calling for research to engage more substantially with both the methodological questions accompanying the study of the financialization of nature, and the class dimensions of the process.},

	abstract = {Environmental politics, argues French philosopher Bruno Latour, have been a ‘disappointment’. Rather than trying to bring environmental concerns into a political world split into two – between Nature/Science and politics/society – Latour argues that environmental movements ought to focus on destroying this two-house collective, and develop ‘an understanding of ecological crises that no longer uses nature to account for the tasks to be accomplished’. In this paper I put my research on the politics and science of the Great Bear Rainforest (GBR), a large tract of temperate rainforest on the central and north coast of British Columbia, into direct conversation with Latour’s arguments about science, epistemology and environmental politics. The GBR was a site of intense political struggle focused predominantly on the scale and scope of industrial forestry, a struggle which ‘ended’ in 2006 with what some call a historic compromise between some high-profile environmental groups, First Nations, the Provincial government, and the forest industry. This paper focuses on two interlinked questions: do the environmental organizations at the centre of the struggle demonstrate the maladies identified by Latour; are they too preoccupied with representing Nature through Science? And second, do these maladies help us explain or understand the politics over the GBR? Were the politics of the GBR limited by environmentalist invocations of a singular Nature through Science, what Latour calls ‘Naturpolitik’? The encounter between theory and practice leads to a more cautious and critical assessment of the environmental politics in the GBR, but also tempers Latour’s arguments. Environmentalists in the GBR do exhibit Latour’s maladies, but in tracing the Politics of Nature there, it seems that Naturpolitik is not as powerful as Latour argues.},

While geographers have questioned the ability of conservation finance to play a significant role in international biodiversity conservation, an emerging cohort of boutique private equity firms are actively generating returns on North American conservation projects. This raises the question: how are these firms generating profits, and in turn, returns for their shareholders? Drawing from a Marxian understanding of finance as redistributive, I argue that these firms are generating profits through a process similar to a corporate hostile takeover. Using the examples of ranchland and timberland investment in the United States, I show that (1) the materialities and historical geographies of these landscapes play a crucial role their monetization, and (2) shareholder returns are generated through a combination of traditional real estate sales and revaluations, public monies, and commodity production.},

A sample of five social entrepreneurs and 15 beneficiaries were interviewed. Findings The findings revealed that there is an association between active social entrepreneurship and post conflict recovery. Social entrepreneurship was found to create opportunity recognition, networking and innovation at both an individual and societal level. Research limitations/implications The generalization of the findings was limited by sample and method.

	isbn = {978-0-674-01289-9},
	abstract = {A major work by one of the more innovative thinkers of our time, Politics of Nature does nothing less than establish the conceptual context for political ecology--transplanting the terms of ecology into more fertile philosophical soil than its proponents have thus far envisioned. Bruno Latour announces his project dramatically: "Political ecology has nothing whatsoever to do with nature, this jumble of Greek philosophy, French Cartesianism and American parks." Nature, he asserts, far from being an obvious domain of reality, is a way of assembling political order without due process. Thus, his book proposes an end to the old dichotomy between nature and society--and the constitution, in its place, of a collective, a community incorporating humans and nonhumans and building on the experiences of the sciences as they are actually practiced.  In a critique of the distinction between fact and value, Latour suggests a redescription of the type of political philosophy implicated in such a "commonsense" division--which here reveals itself as distinctly uncommonsensical and in fact fatal to democracy and to a healthy development of the sciences. Moving beyond the modernist institutions of "mononaturalism" and "multiculturalism," Latour develops the idea of "multinaturalism," a complex collectivity determined not by outside experts claiming absolute reason but by "diplomats" who are flexible and open to experimentation.

Political Ecology!  Summary of the Argument (for Readers in a Hurry...) Glossary Notes Bibliography Index From the book: What is to be done with political ecology? Nothing. What is to be done? Political ecology! All those who have hoped that the politics of nature would bring about a renewal of public life have asked the first question, while noting the stagnation of the so-called "green" movements. They would like very much to know why so promising an endeavor has so often come to naught. Appearances notwithstanding, everyone is bound to answer the second question the same way. We have no choice: politics does not fall neatly on one side of a divide and nature on the other. From the time the term "politics" was invented, every type of politics has been defined by its relation to nature, whose every feature, property, and function depends on the polemical will to limit, reform, establish, short-circuit, or enlighten public life. As a result, we cannot choose whether to engage in it surreptitiously, by distinguishing between questions of nature and questions of politics, or explicitly, by treating those two sets of questions as a single issue that arises for all collectives. While the ecology movements tell us that nature is rapidly invading politics, we shall have to imagine - most often aligning ourselves with these movements but sometimes against them - what a politics finally freed from the sword of Damocles we call nature might be like.},

	abstract = {Haida Gwaii and the Great Bear Rainforest (GBR) comprise the world’s largest intact coastal temperate rainforest. British Columbia has encouraged industrial logging of this region. As a result, ecological values have been eroded and natural capital has been drawn down. The logging industry has provided few local economic benefits. Colonization and industrial resource extraction have contributed to high levels of social distress in First Nations communities. Since 2001, logging companies, environmental organizations, and the provincial and First Nations governments have collaborated in developing an Ecosystem Based Management (EBM) approach. EBM is intended to maintain ecosystem integrity and improve human wellbeing. In 2006, the province began implementing EBM by setting aside one third of the GBR’s land base from logging and by proposing transitional EBM requirements. This paper draws on stumpage and forest cover data to analyze natural capital depletion. The analysis indicates that much of the GBR’s natural capital, as represented by timber, has been depleted. Industrial logging was already on the decline before the decision was taken to implement an EBM approach. Expectations for improved socio-economic outcomes under EBM may not be realistic given the constraints implied by past logging. If EBM performance is measured using conventional economic indicators without accounting for past depletion, it risks being found to have failed the goal of improving human wellbeing. This would create pressure to relax EBM provisions to allow more logging, an outcome that would fail both ecosystems and human communities in the long term. If much reduced extraction levels are to support local human wellbeing, a greater share of economic benefits must be retained locally.},

We highlight how these threats have affected the conservation status and ecological functioning of the 31 largest mammalian carnivores on Earth. Consistent with theory, empirical studies increasingly show that large carnivores have substantial effects on the structure and function of diverse ecosystems. Significant cascading trophic interactions, mediated by their prey or sympatric mesopredators, arise when some of these carnivores are extirpated from or repatriated to ecosystems. Unexpected effects of trophic cascades on various taxa and processes include changes to bird, mammal, invertebrate, and herpetofauna abundance or richness; subsidies to scavengers; altered disease dynamics; carbon sequestration; modified stream morphology; and crop damage. Promoting tolerance and coexistence with large carnivores is a crucial societal challenge that will ultimately determine the fate of Earth's largest carnivores and all that depends upon them, including humans.},

	abstract = {Mammalian predator-prey systems are behaviorally sophisticated games of stealth and fear. But, traditional mass-action models of predator prey dynamics treat individuals as behaviorally unresponsive "molecules" in Brownian motion. Foraging theory should provide the conceptual framework to envision the interaction. But, current models of predator feeding behavior generally envision a clever predator consuming large numbers of sessile and behaviorally inert prey (e. g., kangaroo rats, Dipodomys, collecting seeds from food patches). Here, we extend foraging theory to consider a predator-prey game of stealth and fear and then embed this game into the modeling of predator-prey population dynamics. The melding of the prey and predator's optimal behaviors with their population and community-level consequences constitutes the ecology of fear. The ecology of fear identifies the endpoints of a continuum of N-driven (population size) versus μ-driven (fear) systems. In N-driven systems, the major direct dynamical feedback involves predators killing prey, whereas μ-driven systems involve the indirect effects from changes in fear levels and prey catchability. In μ-driven systems, prey respond to predators by becoming more vigilant or by moving away from suspected predators. In this way, a predator (e. g., mountain lion, Puma concolor) depletes a food patch (e. g., local herd of mule deer, Odocoileus hemionus) by frightening prey rather than by actually killing prey. Behavior buffers the system: a reduction in predator numbers should rapidly engender less vigilant and more catchable prey. The ecology of fear explains why big fierce carnivores should be and can be rare. In carnivore systems, ignore the behavioral game at one's peril.},

Several authors have suggested that wolves interact with certain terrain features, creating places of high predation risk at fine spatial scales, and that elk avoid these places, which creates refugia for plants. This hypothesized BMTC could release aspen from elk browsing pressure, leading to a patchy recovery in places of high risk. I tested whether four specific, hypothesized fine-scale risk factors are correlated with changes in current elk browsing pressure on aspen, or with aspen recruitment since wolf reintroduction, in the Daly Creek drainage in Yellowstone National Park, and near two aspen enclosures outside of the park boundary. Aspen were not responding to hypothesized fine-scale risk factors in ways consistent with the current BMTC hypothesis.},

	abstract = {Trophic cascades are textbook examples of predator indirect effects on ecological systems. Yet there is considerable debate about their nature, strength and overall importance. This debate stems in part from continued uncertainty about the ultimate mechanisms driving cascading effects. We present a synthesis of empirical evidence in support of one possible ultimate mechanism: the foraging-predation risk trade-offs undertaken by intermediary species. We show that simple trade-off behaviour can lead to both positive and negative indirect effects of predators on plant resources and hence can explain considerable contingency on the nature and strength of cascading effects among systems. Thus, predicting the sign and strength of indirect effect simply requires knowledge of habitat and resource use by prey with regard to predators’ presence, habitat use and hunting mode. The synthesis allows us to postulate a hypothesis for new conceptualization of trophic cascades which is to be viewed as an ultimate trade-off between intervening species. In this context, different predators apply different rules of engagement based on their hunting mode and habitat use. These different rules then determine whether behavioural effects persist or attenuate at the level of the food chain.},

The landscape of fear represents relative levels of predation risk as peaks and valleys that reflect the level of fear of predation a prey experiences in different parts of its area of use. We provide observations in support of this model regarding changes in predation risk with respect to habitat types, and terrain characteristics. We postulate that animals have the ability to learn and can respond to differing levels of predation risk. We propose that the landscape of fear can be quantified with the use of well documented existing methods such as givingup densities, vigilance observations, and foraging surveys of plants. We conclude that the landscape of fear is a useful visual model and has the potential to become a unifying ecological concept.},

	abstract = {A “landscape of fear” (LOF) is a map that describes continuous spatial variation in an animal’s perception of predation risk. The relief on this map reflects, for example, places that an animal avoids to minimize risk. Although the LOF concept is a potentially unifying theme in ecology that is often invoked to explain the ecological and conservation significance of fear, little is known about the daily dynamics of an LOF. Despite theory and data to the contrary, investigators often assume, implicitly or explicitly, that an LOF is a static consequence of a predator’s mere presence within an ecosystem. We tested the prediction that an LOF in a large-scale, free-living system is a highly dynamic map with “peaks” and “valleys” that alternate across the diel (24-h) cycle in response to daily lulls in predator activity. We did so with extensive data from the case study of Yellowstone elk (Cervus elaphus) and wolves (Canis lupus) that was the original basis for the LOF concept. We quantified the elk LOF, defined here as spatial allocation of time away from risky places and times, across nearly 1,000km2 of northern Yellowstone National Park and found that it fluctuated with the crepuscular activity pattern of wolves, enabling elk to use risky places during wolf downtimes. This may help explain evidence that wolf predation risk has no effect on elk stress levels, body condition, pregnancy, or herbivory. The ability of free-living animals to adaptively allocate habitat use across periods of high and low predator activity within the diel cycle is an underappreciated aspect of animal behavior that helps explain why strong antipredator responses may trigger weak ecological effects, and why an LOF may have less conceptual and practical importance than direct killing.},

	abstract = {Landscapes of Fear (LOF), the spatially explicit distribution of perceived predation risk as seen by a population, is increasingly cited in ecological literature and has become a frequently used ‘‘buzz-word’’. With the increase in popularity, it became necessary to clarify the definition for the term, suggest boundaries and propose a common framework for its use. The LOF, as a progeny of the ‘‘ecology of fear’’ conceptual framework, defines fear as the strategic manifestation of the cost-benefit analysis of food and safety tradeoffs. In addition to direct predation risk, the LOF is affected by individuals’ energetic-state, inter- and intra-specific competition and is constrained by the evolutionary history of each species. Herein, based on current applications of the LOF conceptual framework, I suggest the future research in this framework will be directed towards: (1) finding applied management uses as a trait defining a population’s habitat-use and habitat-suitability; (2) studying multi-dimensional distribution of risk-assessment through time and space; (3) studying variability between individuals within a population; (4) measuring eco-neurological implications of risk as a feature of environmental heterogeneity and (5) expanding temporal and spatial scales of empirical studies.},

	abstract = {A trophic cascade recently has been reported among wolves, elk, and aspen on the northern winter range of Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA, but the mechanisms of indirect interactions within this food chain have yet to be established. We investigated whether the observed trophic cascade might have a behavioral basis by exploring environmental factors inﬂuencing the movements of 13 female elk equipped with GPS radio collars. We developed a simple statistical approach that can unveil the concurrent inﬂuence of several environmental features on animal movements. Paths of elk traveling on their winter range were broken down into steps, which correspond to the straight-line segment between successive locations at 5-hour intervals. Each observed step was paired with 200 random steps having the same starting point, but differing in length and/or direction. Comparisons between the characteristics of observed and random steps using conditional logistic regression were used to model environmental features inﬂuencing movement patterns. We found that elk movements were inﬂuenced by multiple factors, such as the distance from roads, the presence of a steep slope along the step, and the cover type in which they ended. The inﬂuence of cover type on elk movements depended on the spatial distribution of wolves across the northern winter range of the park. In low wolf-use areas, the relative preference for end point locations of steps followed: aspen stands Ͼ open areas Ͼ conifer forests. As the risks of wolf encounter increased, the preference of elk for aspen stands gradually decreased, and selection became strongest for steps ending in conifer forests in high wolf-use areas. Our study clariﬁes the behavioral mechanisms involved in the trophic cascade of Yellowstone’s wolf–elk–aspen system: elk respond to wolves on their winter range by a shift in habitat selection, which leads to local reductions in the use of aspen by elk.},

Our results indicate that predation risk may have profound effects on the structure of ecosystems and is an important constituent of native biodiversity. Our conclusions are based on theory involving trophic cascades, predation risk, and optimal foraging; on the research literature; and on our own recent studies in Yellowstone National Park.

	abstract = {The 1995/1996 reintroduction of gray wolves (Canis lupus) into Yellowstone National Park after a 70 year absence has allowed for studies of tri-trophic cascades involving wolves, elk (Cervus elaphus), and plant species such as aspen (Populus tremuloides), cottonwoods (Populus spp.), and willows (Salix spp.). To investigate the status of this cascade, in September of 2010 we repeated an earlier survey of aspen and measured browsing and heights of young aspen in 97 stands along four streams in the Lamar River catchment of the park’s northern winter range. We found that browsing on the ﬁve tallest young aspen in each stand decreased from 100\% of all measured leaders in 1998 to means of {\textless}25\% in the uplands and {\textless}20\% in riparian areas by 2010. Correspondingly, aspen recruitment (i.e., growth of seedlings/sprouts above the browse level of ungulates) increased as browsing decreased over time in these same stands. We repeated earlier inventories of cottonwoods and found that recruitment had also increased in recent years. We also synthesized studies on trophic cascades published during the ﬁrst 15 years after wolf reintroduction. Synthesis results generally indicate that the reintroduction of wolves restored a trophic cascade with woody browse species growing taller and canopy cover increasing in some, but not all places. After wolf reintroduction, elk populations decreased, but both beaver (Caster canadensis) and bison (Bison bison) numbers increased, possibly due to the increase in available woody plants and herbaceous forage resulting from less competition with elk. Trophic cascades research during the ﬁrst 15 years after wolf reintroduction indicated substantial initial effects on both plants and animals, but northern Yellowstone still appears to be in the early stages of ecosystem recovery. In ecosystems where wolves have been displaced or locally extirpated, their reintroduction may represent a particularly effective approach for passive restoration.},

	abstract = {Glyphosate has been the most widely used herbicide worldwide over the last three decades, raising increasing concerns for its potential impacts on environmental and human health. Recent studies revealed that glyphosate occurs in soil, surface water, and groundwater, and residues are found at all levels of the food chain, such as drinking water, plants, animals, and even in humans. While research has demonstrated that glyphosate can induce a broad range of biological effects in exposed organisms, the global molecular mechanisms of action still need to be elucidated, in particular for marine species. In this study, we characterized for the ﬁrst time the molecular mechanisms of action of glyphosate in a marine bivalve species after exposure to environmentally realistic concentrations. To reach such a goal, Mediterranean mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis, an ecologically and economically relevant species, were exposed for 21 days to 10, 100, and 1000 mg/L and digestive gland transcriptional proﬁles were investigated through RNA-seq. Differential expression analysis identiﬁed a total of 111, 124, and 211 differentially regulated transcripts at glyphosate concentrations of 10, 100, and 1000 mg/L, respectively. Five genes were found consistently differentially expressed at all investigated concentrations, including SERP2, which plays a role in the protection of unfolded target proteins against degradation, the antiapoptotic protein GIMAP5, and MTMR14, which is involved in macroautophagy. Functional analysis of differentially expressed genes reveals the disruption of several key biological processes, such as energy metabolism and Ca2þ homeostasis, cell signalling, and endoplasmic reticulum stress response. Together, the results obtained suggest that the presence of glyphosate in the marine ecosystem should raise particular concern because of its signiﬁcant effects even at the lowest concentration.},

While neutral models have since been applied to a broad range of ecological and macroecological phenomena, the majority of research relating to neutral theory has focused exclusively on the species abundance distribution (SAD). Here, we synthesize the large body of work on neutral theory in the context of the species abundance distribution, with a particular focus on integrating ideas from neutral theory with traditional niche theory. First, we summarize the basic tenets of neutral theory; both in general and in the context of SADs. Second, we explore the issues associated with neutral theory and the SAD, such as complications with fitting and model comparison, the underlying assumptions of neutral models, and the difficultly of linking pattern to process. Third, we highlight the advances in understanding of SADs that have resulted from neutral theory and models. Finally, we focus consideration on recent developments aimed at unifying neutral- and niche-based approaches to ecology, with a particular emphasis on what this means for SAD theory, embracing, for instance, ideas of emergent neutrality and stochastic niche theory. We put forward the argument that the prospect of the unification of niche and neutral perspectives represents one of the most promising future avenues of neutral theory research.},

Uniﬁed theories have been important in physics including the uniﬁcation of electricity and magnetism and the uniﬁcation of the electromagnetic with the weak nuclear force. Surprisingly, ecology, speciﬁcally the subﬁelds of biodiversity and macroecology, also possess not one but at least six uniﬁed theories. This is problematic as only one uniﬁed theory is desirable. Superﬁcially, the six uniﬁed theories seem very different. However, I show that all six theories use the same three rules or assertions to describe a stochastic geometry of biodiversity. The three rules are: (1) intraspeciﬁcally individuals are clumped together; (2) interspeciﬁcally global or regional abundance varies according to a hollow curve distribution; and (3) interspeciﬁcally individuals are placed without regard to individuals of other species. These three rules appear sufﬁcient to explain local species abundance distributions, species–area relationships, decay of similarity of distance and possibly other patterns of biodiversity. This provides a uniﬁcation of the uniﬁed theories. I explore implications of this uniﬁed theory for future research.},

Here, we use the model keystone species Daphnia pulex to study environmental responses of genes in the context of their gene family history to better understand the relationship between genome structure and gene function in response to environmental stimuli. Daphnia were exposed to five different treatments, each consisting of a diet supplemented with one of five cyanobacterial species, and a control treatment consisting of a diet of only green algae. Differential gene expression profiles of Daphnia exposed to each of these five cyanobacterial species showed that genes with known functions are more likely to be shared by different expression profiles, whereas genes specific to the lineage of Daphnia are more likely to be unique to a given expression profile. Furthermore, while only a small number of nonlineage-specific genes were conserved across treatment type, there was a high degree of overlap in expression profiles at the functional level. The conservation of functional responses across the different cyanobacterial treatments can be attributed to the treatment-specific expression of different paralogous genes within the same gene family. Comparison with available gene expression data in the literature suggests differences in nutritional composition in diets with cyanobacterial species compared to diets of green algae as a primary driver for cyanobacterial effects on Daphnia. We conclude that conserved functional responses in Daphnia across different cyanobacterial treatments are mediated through alternate regulation of paralogous gene families.},

In this study, the effects of HMF on the reproduction and survival of Daphnia magna were assessed through validated ecotoxicological tests. The mechanism of toxicity was determined by analysis of transcriptomic responses induced by exposure to different concentrations of HMF using RNA sequencing. HMF exerted toxicity to D. magna with an EC50 for effects on reproduction of 17.2 mg/l. HMF exposure affected molecular pathways including sugar and polysaccharide metabolism, lipid metabolism, general stress metabolism and red blood cell metabolism, although most molecular pathways affected by HMF exposure were dose specific. Hemoglobin genes, however, responded in a sensitive and dose-related manner. No induction of genes involved in the xenobiotic metabolism or oxidative stress metabolism pathway could be observed, which contrasted earlier observations on transcriptional responses of the terrestrial model Folsomia candida exposed to the same compound in a similar dose. We found 4189 orthologue genes between D. magna and F. candida, yet only twenty-one genes of those orthologues were co-regulated in both species. The contrasting transcriptional responses to the same compound exposed at a similar dose between D. magna and F. candida indicates limited overlap in stress responses among soil and aquatic invertebrates. The dose-related expression of hemoglobin provides further support for using hemoglobin expression as a biomarker for general stress responses in daphnids.},

We aim to characterize the population level transcriptomic responses, which include standing genetic variation, and improve our understanding on how populations respond to environmental stress at a molecular level. We studied population level responses to two heavy metals, copper and arsenic, and their binary mixture across time. Transcriptomic patterns identified significantly regulated gene families and genes at the population level including cuticle proteins and resilins. Furthermore, some of these differentially regulated gene families, such as cuticle proteins, were also significantly enriched for genetic variations including SNPs and MNPs. In general, genetic variation was observed in specific gene families, many of which are known to be involved in stress response. Overall, our results indicate that molecular stress responses can be identified within natural populations and that linking molecular mechanisms with genetic variation at the population level could contribute significantly to adverse outcome frameworks.},

	abstract = {Benzotriazoles (BZTs) are ubiquitous aquatic contaminants used in a wide range of industrial and domestic applications from aircraft deicers to dishwasher tablets. Acute toxicity has been reported in aquatic organisms for some of the BZTs but their mode of action remains unknown. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the transcriptomic response of D. magna exposed to sublethal doses of 1H-benzotriazole (BTR), 5-methyl-1H-benzotriazole (5MeBTR) and 5-chloro-1H-benzotriazole (5ClBTR) using RNA-sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR. Cellular and life-history endpoints (survival, number of neonates, growth) were also investigated. Significant effects on the molting frequency were observed after 21-d exposure to 5MeBTR and 5ClBTR. No effects on molting frequency were observed for BTR but RNA-seq results indicated that this BZT induced the up-regulation of genes coding for cuticular proteins, which could have compensated the molting disruption. Molting in cladocerans is actively controlled by ecdysteroid hormones. Complementary short-term temporal analysis (4- and 8-d exposure) of the transcription of genes related to molting and hormone-mediated processes indicated that the three compounds had specific modes of action. BTR induced the transcription of genes involved in 20-hydroxyecdysone synthesis, which suggests pro-ecdysteroid properties. 5ClBTR exposure induced protein activity and transcriptional levels of chitinase enzymes, associated with an impact on ecdysteroid signaling pathways, which could explain the decrease in molt frequency. Finally, 5MeBTR seemed to increase molt frequency through epigenetic processes. Overall, results suggested that molting effects observed at the physiological level could be linked to endocrine regulation impacts of BZTs at the molecular level.},

Significant amounts of Bt-plant residues, and thus Cry-toxins, will be shed to soil and aquatic environments. We exposed Daphnia magna to purified Cry1Ab and Cry2Aa toxins for the full life-span of the animals. We used single toxins in different doses and combinations of toxins and Roundup®, another potential stressor on the rise in agricultural ecosystems. Animals exposed to 4.5 mg/L (ppm) of Cry1Ab, Cry2Aa and the combination of both showed markedly higher mortality, smaller body size and very low juvenile production compared to controls. Animals exposed to 0.75 mg/L also showed a tendency towards increased mortality but with increased early fecundity compared to the controls. Roundup® stimulated animals to strong early reproductive output at the cost of later rapid mortality. We conclude that i) purified Cry-toxins in high concentrations are toxic to D. magna, indicating alternative modes-of-action for these Cry-toxins; ii) Cry-toxins act in combination, indicating that ‘stacked events’ may have stronger effects on non-target organisms; iii) further studies need to be done on combinatorial effects of multiple Cry-toxins and herbicides that co-occur in the environment.},

The waterflea Daphnia magna is an established ecological and toxicological model species, central to the food webs of freshwater lentic habitats and sentinel for water quality. Its tractability and cyclic parthenogenetic life-cycle are ideal to investigate links between genes and the environment. Capitalizing on this unique model system, the STRESSFLEA consortium generated a comprehensive RNA-Seq data set by exposing two inbred genotypes of D. magna and a recombinant cross of these genotypes to a range of environmental perturbations. Gene models were constructed from the transcriptome data and mapped onto the draft genome of D. magna using EvidentialGene. The transcriptome data generated here, together with the available draft genome sequence of D. magna and a high-density genetic map will be a key asset for future investigations in environmental genomics.

	abstract = {To enable successful management of marine bioinvasions, timely and robust scientific advice is required. This knowledge should inform managers and stakeholders on the magnitude of a pressure (rate of human-mediated introductions), the environmental state of an ecosystem (impacts of non-indigenous species), and the success of management response (prevention, eradication, mitigation). This advice often relies on baseline biodiversity information in the form of measureable parameters (metrics). This can be derived from conventional approaches such as visual surveys, but also by utilizing environmental DNA/RNA-based molecular techniques, which are increasingly being touted as promising tools for assessing biodiversity and detecting rare or invasive species. Depending on the stage of incursion, each approach has merits and limitations. In this review we assess the performance of biosecurity-relevant biodiversity parameters derived from eDNA/eRNA samples and discuss the results in relation to different stages of invasion and management applications. The overall performance of considered methods ranged between 42 and 75\% based on defined criteria, with target-specific approaches scoring higher in general. Caveats are discussed along with avenues which may enhance these techniques and their successful uptake for marine biosecurity surveillance and management. To facilitate and encourage uptake of these techniques, there is a need for an international collaborative framework aimed at unifying molecular sampling and analysis methodologies. Improvement of quantitative capacity and cost-efficiency will also enhance their integration in biosecurity programmes.},

	abstract = {Copper pollution is pervasive in aquatic habitats and is particularly harmful to invertebrates sensitive to environmental changes such as Daphnia pulex. Mechanisms of toxicity and tolerance to copper are not well understood. We used RNA-sequencing to investigate these mechanisms in three genetically distinct D. pulex clonal lineages with different histories of copper exposure. Upregulated genes after copper exposure were enriched with Gene Ontology (GO) categories involved in digestion, molting and growth, whereas downregulated genes after copper exposure were enriched in the metal-regulatory system, immune response and epigenetic modifications. The three D. pulex clones in our study show largely similar transcriptional patterns in response to copper, with only a total of twenty genes differentially expressed in a single clonal lineages. We also detected lower relative expression of some genes known to be important for copper tolerance, metallothionein and glutathione-S-transferase, in a sensitive lineage sampled from an uncontaminated habitat. Daphnia-specific genes (without orthologs outside the genus) and Daphnia-specific duplications (genes duplicated in the Daphnia lineage) were overrepresented in differentially expressed genes, highlighting an important role for newly emerged genes in tolerating environmental stressors. The results indicate that the D. pulex lineages tested in this study generally respond to copper stress using the same major pathways, but that the more resistant clone with previous copper exposure might be better able to regulate key genes. This finding highlights the important nuances in gene expression among clones, shaped by historical exposure and influencing copper tolerance.},

Samples obtained from diatom-rich communities in the Bransfield Strait, the western Weddell Sea and sea ice in the Bellingshausen Sea/Wilkins Ice Shelf yielded more than 500K pyrosequencing reads that were combined to produce a global metatranscriptome assembly. Multi-gene phylogenies recovered three distinct communities, and diatom-assigned contigs further indicated little read-sharing between communities, validating an assembly-based annotation and analysis approach. Although functional analysis recovered a core of abundant shared annotations that were expressed across the three diatom communities, over 40\% of annotations (but accounting for {\textless}10\% of sequences) were community-specific. The two pelagic communities differed in their expression of N-metabolism and acquisition genes, which was almost absent in post-bloom conditions in the Weddell Sea community, while enrichment of transporters for ammonia and urea in Bransfield Strait diatoms suggests a physiological stance towards acquisition of reduced N-sources. The depletion of carbohydrate and energy metabolism pathways in sea ice relative to pelagic communities, together with increased light energy dissipation (via LHCSR proteins), photorespiration, and NO3− uptake and utilization all pointed to irradiance stress and/or inorganic carbon limitation within sea ice. Ice-binding proteins and cold-shock transcription factors were also enriched in sea ice diatoms. Surprisingly, the abundance of gene transcripts for the translational machinery tracked decreasing environmental temperature across only a 4 °C range, possibly reflecting constraints on translational efficiency and protein production in cold environments.},

Characterization of the metaproteome is expected to provide data linking genetic and functional diversity of microbial communities. Studies on the metaproteome together with those on the metagenome and the metatranscriptome will contribute to progress in our knowledge of microbial communities and their contribution in ecosystem functioning. Effectiveness of the metaproteomic approach will be improved as increasing metagenomic information is made available thanks to the environmental sequencing projects currently running. More specifically, analysis of metaproteome in contrasted environmental situations should allow (1) tracking new functional genes and metabolic pathways and (2) identifying proteins preferentially associated with specific stresses. These proteins considered as functional bioindicators should contribute, in the future, to help policy makers in defining strategies for sustainable management of our environment.},

The rapidly expanding study of eDNA has generated unprecedented ability to detect species and conduct genetic analyses for conservation, management, and research, particularly in scenarios where collection of whole organisms is impractical or impossible. While the number of studies demonstrating successful eDNA detection has increased rapidly in recent years, less research has explored the “ecology” of eDNA—myriad interactions between extraorganismal genetic material and its environment—and its influence on eDNA detection, quantification, analysis, and application to conservation and research. Here, we outline a framework for understanding the ecology of eDNA, including the origin, state, transport, and fate of extraorganismal genetic material. Using this framework, we review and synthesize the findings of eDNA studies from diverse environments, taxa, and fields of study to highlight important concepts and knowledge gaps in eDNA study and application. Additionally, we identify frontiers of conservation-focused eDNA application where we see the most potential for growth, including the use of eDNA for estimating population size, population genetic and genomic analyses via eDNA, inclusion of other indicator biomolecules such as environmental RNA or proteins, automated sample collection and analysis, and consideration of an expanded array of creative environmental samples. We discuss how a more complete understanding of the ecology of eDNA is integral to advancing these frontiers and maximizing the potential of future eDNA applications in conservation and research.},

Using a quantitative environmental DNA methodology, we assessed spatial variation in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) eDNA concentration, originating from four active salmon farms, along ∼55 km of narrow channels in British Columbia, Canada. We evaluated eDNA from 36 and 47 seawater samples collected at 2 and 8 m depths, respectively, at 0.3–3 km intervals along the channels. We fitted a Laplace dispersal kernel to eDNA data separately for 2 and 8 m depths. The model estimates that 95\% of eDNA spread at 2 m depth was within 1.6 km upstream and 3.2 km downstream from farms relative to a prevailing current, and this was expanded at 8 m (1.8 km upstream; 3.7 km downstream). Our modeling results were robust to multiple sources of simulated uncertainty associated with sampling regime and variable eDNA shedding rates. Our results provide a benchmark for the spatial spread of biological material such as pathogens or eDNA from invasive or imperilled species in a coastal marine context. This work has implications for the interpretation of eDNA data for species surveillance and predicting disease spread.},

Using a quantitative environmental DNA methodology, we assessed pathogen environmental DNA in relation to salmon farms in coastal British Columbia, Canada, by testing for 39 species of salmon pathogens (viral, bacterial, and eukaryotic) in 134 marine environmental samples at 58 salmon farm sites (both active and inactive) over 3 years. Environmental DNA from 22 pathogen species was detected 496 times and species varied in their occurrence among years and sites, likely reflecting variation in environmental factors, other native host species, and strength of association with domesticated Atlantic salmon. Overall, we found that the probability of detecting pathogen environmental DNA (eDNA) was 2.72 (95\% CI: 1.48, 5.02) times higher at active versus inactive salmon farm sites and 1.76 (95\% CI: 1.28, 2.42) times higher per standard deviation increase in domesticated Atlantic salmon eDNA concentration at a site. If the distribution of pathogen eDNA accurately reflects the distribution of viable pathogens, our findings suggest that salmon farms serve as a potential reservoir for a number of infectious agents; thereby elevating the risk of exposure for wild salmon and other fish species that share the marine environment.},

The adopted migrant hypothesis proposes a life history in which social learning transmits migratory knowledge between generations of iteroparous fish. Specifically, juveniles disperse from the parental spawning site, encounter and recruit to a local adult population, and learn migration routes between spawning and foraging habitats by following older, experienced fish. Although the adopted migrant life history may apply to many species of pelagic marine fishes, there is scant theoretical or empirical work on the consequent population dynamics. We developed and analyzed a mathematical model of this life history in which the recruitment of juveniles depends on the relative abundance of the local populations and recruitment overlap, which measures the ease with which juveniles are recruited by a nonparental population. We demonstrate that the adopted migrant life history can maintain spatial demographic structure among local populations, that it can also predispose local populations to collapse when a tipping point is crossed, and that recovery after collapse is impaired by reduced recruitment at small local population sizes.},

We evaluated whether sea louse infection is associated with decreased stomach fullness of wild juvenile sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) in Johnstone Strait, British Columbia, during their marine migration from the Fraser River. Caligus clemensi comprised 98.6\% of the pre-adult and adult lice and 86.5\% of the copepodites (freshly attached juvenile lice); the rest were Lepeophtheirus salmonis. We found that infection status was an important predictor of relative stomach fullness for juvenile sockeye (wet stomach content mass divided by body mass), as indicated by mixed-effects model selection, and that highly infected fish had 17\% ± 8\% lower relative stomach fullness than did lightly infected fish. This louse-associated reduction in relative stomach fullness occurs as the juvenile sockeye migrate through a food-limited environment and, presumably, elevated competition. Given that early marine growth for juvenile salmon is often a predictor of survival, our results highlight the importance of understanding sublethal effects of parasites on salmonids and possibly other fish species.},

	abstract = {Global fisheries landings ceased increasing decades ago, causing an increasing shortfall in wild seafood supply and an expansion of aquaculture. The abundance of domesticated fishes now dwarfs related wild fishes in some coastal seas, changing the dynamics of their infectious diseases. Transport and trade of seafood, feed, eggs, and broodstock bring pathogens into new regions and into contact with naïve hosts. Density-dependent transmission creates threshold effects where disease can abruptly switch from endemic to epizootic dynamics. Hydrodynamics allow pathogens to disperse broadly, interconnecting farms into metapopulations of domesticated host fish in regions that also support related species of wild fish. Spillover and spillback dynamics of pathogen transmission between wild and farmed fish can create novel transmission pathways or bioamplify pathogen abundance, potentially depressing or endangering wild fish. Mortality from natural predator–prey interactions may be synergistic or compensatory with these increased infections. Domestic environments may favour the evolution of undesirable pathogen traits, such as virulence and drug resistance, leading to the emergence of strains that cause high mortality and (or) evade treatment. Overall, these changes to the dynamics of infectious disease in coastal seas impose new constraints on the sustainability of both wild and farmed fish.},

In multi-host systems, parasites may mediate food web dynamics with unexpected outcomes for host populations. Models have been used to explore the potential consequences of interactions between hosts, parasites and predators, but connections between theory and data are rare. Here, we consider sea louse parasites (Lepeophtheirus salmonis), which directly increase mortality of juvenile salmon hosts (Oncorhynchus spp.). We use mathematical models and field-based experiments to investigate how the indirect effects of parasitism via predation influence mortality of sympatric juvenile chum salmon (O. keta) and pink salmon (O. gorbuscha). Our experiments show that coho salmon predators (O. kisutch) selectively prey on pink salmon and on parasitized prey. Preference for pink salmon increased slightly when prey were parasitized by sea lice, although there was considerable uncertainty regarding this result. Despite this uncertainty, we show that even the small increase in preference that we observed may be biologically significant. We calculate a critical threshold of pink salmon abundance above which chum salmon may experience a parasite-mediated release from predation as predation shifts towards preferred prey species. This work highlights the importance of considering community interactions, such as predation, when assessing the risk that emerging parasites and pathogens pose to wildlife populations.},

Pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) exhibited increased variability and autocorrelation in populations that had a growth parameter, r, close to zero, consistent with EWS of extinction. However, models and data for sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) indicate that portfolio effects from heterogeneity in age-at-maturity may obscure EWS. Chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) show intermediate results. The data do not reveal EWS of Ricker-type bifurcations that cause oscillations and chaos at high r.

	abstract = {The impact of parasites on hosts is invariably negative when considered in isolation, but may be complex and unexpected in nature. For example, if parasites make hosts less desirable to predators then gains from reduced predation may offset direct costs of being parasitized. We explore these ideas in the context of sea louse infestations on salmon. In Pacific Canada, sea lice can spread from farmed salmon to migrating juvenile wild salmon. Low numbers of sea lice can cause mortality of juvenile pink and chum salmon. For pink salmon, this has resulted in reduced productivity of river populations exposed to salmon farming. However, for chum salmon, we did not find an effect of sea louse infestations on productivity, despite high statistical power. Motivated by this unexpected result, we used a mathematical model to show how a parasite-induced shift in predation pressure from chum salmon to pink salmon could offset negative direct impacts of sea lice on chum salmon. This shift in predation is proposed to occur because predators show an innate preference for pink salmon prey. This preference may be more easily expressed when sea lice compromise juvenile salmon hosts, making them easier to catch. Our results indicate how the ecological context of host–parasite interactions may dampen, or even reverse, the expected impact of parasites on host populations.},

Several recent studies have reached contradictory conclusions on whether the spread of lice from salmon farms affects the productivity of sympatric wild salmon populations. We analyzed recently available sea lice data on farms and spawner–recruit data for pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) and coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch) salmon populations in the Broughton Archipelago and nearby regions where farms are not present. Our results show that sea lice abundance on farms is negatively associated with productivity of both pink and coho salmon in the Broughton Archipelago.

For Pacific salmon and the parasitic sea louse, Lepeophtheirus salmonis, analysis of the exposure period may resolve conflicting observations of epizootic mortality in field studies and parasite rejection in experiments. This is because exposure periods can differ by 2–3 orders of magnitude, ranging from months in the field to hours in experiments. We developed a mathematical model of salmon–louse population dynamics, parametrized by a study that monitored naturally infected juvenile salmon held in ocean enclosures. Analysis of replicated trials indicates that lice suffer high mortality, particularly during pre-adult stages. The model suggests louse populations rapidly decline following brief exposure of juvenile salmon, similar to laboratory study designs and data. However, when the exposure period lasts for several weeks, as occurs when juvenile salmon migrate past salmon farms, the model predicts that lice accumulate to abundances that can elevate salmon mortality and depress salmon populations. The duration of parasite exposure is probably critical to salmon–louse population dynamics, and should therefore be accommodated in coastal planning and management where fish farms are situated on wild fish migration routes.},

Farmed salmon populations dwarf natural coastal host populations, particularly in winter, leading to biomagnification of louse populations. By spring, there may be large numbers of lice on farmed salmon, and this is associated with recurrent parasite infestations of wild juvenile salmon and depressed wild salmon stocks. Abiotic (eg temperature and salinity), biotic (eg predator abundance and food availability), and management (eg periodically emptying farms and applying chemical parasiticides) factors are thought to mediate the louse threat, but none have been well studied.

In approximately 70\% of trials in which a predator consumed a parasitized prey, lice escaped predation by swimming or moving directly onto the predator. This trophic transmission is strongly male biased, probably because behaviour and morphology constrain female movement and transmission.

One consequence of migration common to marine fish and invertebrates is migratory allopatry—a period of spatial separation between adult and juvenile hosts, which is caused by host migration and which prevents parasite transmission from adult to juvenile hosts. We studied this characteristic for sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis and Caligus clemensi) and pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) from one of the Canada's largest salmon stocks. Migratory allopatry protects juvenile salmon from L. salmonis for two to three months of early marine life (2–3\% prevalence). In contrast, host diversity facilitates access for C. clemensi to juvenile salmon (8–20\% prevalence) but infections appear ephemeral. Aquaculture can augment host abundance and diversity and increase parasite exposure of wild juvenile fish. An empirically parametrized model shows high sensitivity of salmon populations to increased L. salmonis exposure, predicting population collapse at one to five motile L. salmonis per juvenile pink salmon. These results characterize parasite threats of salmon aquaculture to wild salmon populations and show how host migration and diversity are important factors affecting parasite transmission in the oceans.},

	abstract = {Rather than benefiting wild fish, industrial aquaculture may contribute to declines in ocean fisheries and ecosystems. Farm salmon are commonly infected with salmon lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis), which are native ectoparasitic copepods. We show that recurrent louse infestations of wild juvenile pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha), all associated with salmon farms, have depressed wild pink salmon populations and placed them on a trajectory toward rapid local extinction. The louse-induced mortality of pink salmon is commonly over 80\% and exceeds previous fishing mortality. If outbreaks continue, then local extinction is certain, and a 99\% collapse in pink salmon population abundance is expected in four salmon generations. These results suggest that salmon farms can cause parasite outbreaks that erode the capacity of a coastal ecosystem to support wild salmon populations.},

	abstract = {The continuing decline of ocean fisheries and rise of global fish consumption has driven aquaculture growth by 10\% annually over the last decade. The association of fish farms with disease emergence in sympatric wild fish stocks remains one of the most controversial and unresolved threats aquaculture poses to coastal ecosystems and fisheries. We report a comprehensive analysis of the spread and impact of farm-origin parasites on the survival of wild fish populations. We mathematically coupled extensive data sets of native parasitic sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) transmission and pathogenicity on migratory wild juvenile pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) and chum (Oncorhynchus keta) salmon. Farm-origin lice induced 9–95\% mortality in several sympatric wild juvenile pink and chum salmon populations. The epizootics arise through a mechanism that is new to our understanding of emerging infectious diseases: fish farms undermine a functional role of host migration in protecting juvenile hosts from parasites associated with adult hosts. Although the migratory life cycles of Pacific salmon naturally separate adults from juveniles, fish farms provide L. salmonis novel access to juvenile hosts, in this case raising infection rates for at least the first ≈2.5 months of the salmon's marine life (≈80 km of the migration route). Spatial segregation between juveniles and adults is common among temperate marine fishes, and as aquaculture continues its rapid growth, this disease mechanism may challenge the sustainability of coastal ecosystems and economies.},

We report a novel nonlethal sampling procedure for quantifying louse abundances and measures of fish health on wild juvenile pink salmon Oncorhynchus gorbuscha and chum salmon O. keta during their early marine life history phase. The method significantly reduces the resource requirements of sampling programs and provides a desirable nonlethal alternative for studying depressed or threatened populations.

	abstract = {Marine salmon farming has been correlated with parasitic sea lice infestations and concurrent declines of wild salmonids. Here, we report a quantitative analysis of how a single salmon farm altered the natural transmission dynamics of sea lice to juvenile Pacific salmon. We studied infections of sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis and Caligus clemensi ) on juvenile pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) and chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) as they passed an isolated salmon farm during their seaward migration down two long and narrow corridors. Our calculations suggest the infection pressure imposed by the farm was four orders of magnitude greater than ambient levels, resulting in a maximum infection pressure near the farm that was 73 times greater than ambient levels and exceeded ambient levels for 30 km along the two wild salmon migration corridors. The farm-produced cohort of lice parasitizing the wild juvenile hosts reached reproductive maturity and produced a second generation of lice that re-infected the juvenile salmon. This raises the infection pressure from the farm by an additional order of magnitude, with a composite infection pressure that exceeds ambient levels for 75 km of the two migration routes. Amplified sea lice infestations due to salmon farms are a potential limiting factor to wild salmonid conservation.},

	abstract = {The production of farmed salmonids in Chile reached 550 000 t in 2004. The industry is considered to be consolidated, but with potential for further expansion to the south into pristine coastal areas. The environmental impacts of the salmonid farming industry in Chile were reviewed in 1996, and evidence at that time did not suggest significant adverse effects. However, after almost ten years of sustained growth, current evidence indicates that significant loss of benthic biodiversity and localized changes in the physico-chemical properties of sediments have occurred in areas with salmonid farms. Furthermore, the presence of these farms significantly increases in pulses the density of dinoflagellates. Data suggest that escaped farmed fish may have an impact on native species, although their survival in the wild appears low. The abundance of omnivorous diving and carrion-feeding marine birds increased from twofold to fivefold in areas with salmon farms compared with control areas without them. It is urgent that an ecosystem approach be implemented to assess all impacts of salmonid farming on coastal ecosystems in southern Chile.},

	abstract = {Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding can rapidly characterize the composition and diversity of benthic communities, thus it has high potential utility for routine assessments of benthic impacts of marine finfish farming. In this study, 126 sediment grab samples from 42 stations were collected at six salmon farms in British Columbia, Canada. Benthic community changes were assessed by both eDNA metabarcoding of metazoans and macrofaunal polychaete surveys. The latter was done by analysing 11,466 individuals using a combination of morphology-based taxonomy and DNA barcoding. Study objectives were to: (i) compare biotic signals associated with benthic impacts of salmon farming in the two data sources, and (ii) identify potential eDNA indicators to facilitate monitoring in Canada. Alpha diversity parameters were consistently reduced near fish cage edge and negatively correlated with pore-water sulphide concentration, with coefficients ranging from −0.62 to −0.48. Although Polychaeta are a common indicator group, the negative correlation with pore-water sulphide concentration was much stronger for Nematoda OTU richness (correlation coefficient: −0.86) than for Polychaeta (correlation coefficient: −0.38). Presence/absence of Capitella generally agreed well between the two methods despite that they differed in the volume of sediments sampled and the molecular marker used. Multiple approaches were used to identify OTUs related to organic enrichment statuses. We demonstrate that eDNA metabarcoding generates biotic signals that could be leveraged for environmental assessment of benthic impacts of fish farms in multiple ways: both alpha diversity and Nematoda OTU richness could be used to assess the spatial extent of impact, and OTUs related to organic enrichment could be used to develop local biotic indices.},

	abstract = {Coastal aquaculture is a globally expanding enterprise. Currently, 1200 salmon farms operate in coastal Norway, yet their capacity to aggregate and subsequently modify wild fish distributions is poorly known. Aggregations of wild fish at 9 farms and 9 control locations were counted on 3 separate days in June to August 2007. On each sampling occasion, 6 counts were made at 5 distinct depth-strata at each farm and control location. Wild fish were 1 to 3 orders of magnitude more abundant at farms than at control sites, depending on the location. Gadoid fish (Pollachius virens, Gadus morhua and Melanogrammus aeglefinus) dominated farm-associated assemblages and were present across a wide range of sizes, from juveniles to large adults. Estimated total farm-aggregated wild fish biomass averaged 10.2 metric tonnes (t) per farm across the 9 farms (range: 600 kg to 41.6 t). Applied across the geographical range of Norway’s 1200 salmon farms, our estimates indicate that salmon farms attract and aggregate over 12000 t of wild fish into a total of just 750 ha of coastal waters on any given day in summer. Possible consequences of these persistent, substantial aggregations of wild fishes at farms include a heightened potential for the transfer of pathogens from salmon farms to wild fish and among adjacent salmon farms, and altered availability of wild fish to fisheries. Restrictions on fishing in the immediate surrounds of salmon farms may avoid farms acting as ecological traps, particularly for species with depressed populations such as G. morhua, which are highly attracted to farms.},

Secondly, while being good candidates in the light of previous works, DD models fail to account for this pattern, a result that necessitates a search for other mechanisms. Thirdly, a simple diversity-independent model based on area (converted into population size) and age explains 97\% of the variability in species loss rate and appears to be a promising predictive tool to handle extinction debt following habitat loss.},

If the surplus population of the source is large and the per capita deficit in the sink is small, only a small fraction of the total population will occur in areas where local reproduction is sufficient to compensate for local mortality. In this sense, the realized niche may be larger than the fundamental niche.

An analysis of over 50 years of data on sockeye salmon returns to the rivers of Bristol Bay, Alaska, shows just how important this portfolio effect — so-called by analogy with risk-spreading in financial markets — can be. The sockeye salmon fishery is one of the most valuable in the United States, with more than 60\% of it coming from this region. The fact that it is made up of several hundred discrete populations makes the observed population variability about half what would be expected in a single homogenous population, and numerical modelling predicts that a homogenous population would be subject to ten times more fisheries closures. In terms of fisheries management, this work suggests that reducing the homogenizing effects of hatcheries on genetic diversity, protecting weak stocks from over-harvesting in mixed stock fisheries, and maintaining intact habitat networks should be prioritized.},

	abstract = {We explored whether parasites are important in kelp forests by examining their effects on a high‐quality, high‐resolution kelp‐forest food web. After controlling for generic effects of network size, parasites affected kelp‐forest food web structure in some ways consistent with other systems. Parasites increased the trophic span of the web, increasing top predator vulnerability and the longest chain length. Unique links associated with parasites, such as concomitant predation (consumption of parasites along with their hosts by predators) increased the frequency of network motifs involving mutual consumption and decreased niche contiguity of free‐living species. However, parasites also affected kelp‐forest food web structure in ways not seen in other systems. Kelp‐forest parasites are richer and more specialized than other systems. As a result, parasites reduced diet generality and decreased connectance in the kelp forest. Although mutual consumption motifs increased in frequency, this motif type was still a small fraction of all possible motifs, so their increase in frequency was not enough to compensate for the decrease in connectance caused by adding many specialist parasite species.},

The subject is increasingly attracting the attention of health professionals and climate-change scientists, particularly with respect to malaria and other vector-transmitted human diseases. The result has been the emergence of a crisis discipline, reminiscent of the early phases of conservation biology. Latitudinal, altitudinal, seasonal, and interannual associations between climate and disease along with historical and experimental evidence suggest that climate, along with many other factors, can affect infectious diseases in a nonlinear fashion. However, although the globe is significantly warmer than it was a century ago, there is little evidence that climate change has already favored infectious diseases. While initial projections suggested dramatic future increases in the geographic range of infectious diseases, recent models predict range shifts in disease distributions, with little net increase in area. Many factors can affect infectious disease, and some may overshadow the effects of climate.},

	abstract = {Emerging diseases are impacting animals under high-density culture, yet few studies assess their importance to wild populations. Microparasites selected for enhanced virulence in culture settings should be less successful maintaining infectivity in wild populations, as once the host dies, there are limited opportunities to infect new individuals. Instead, moderately virulent microparasites persisting for long periods across multiple environments are of greatest concern. Evolved resistance to endemic microparasites may reduce susceptibilities, but as barriers to microparasite distributions are weakened, and environments become more stressful, unexposed populations may be impacted and pathogenicity enhanced. We provide an overview of the evolutionary and ecological impacts of infectious diseases in wild salmon and suggest ways in which modern technologies can elucidate the microparasites of greatest potential import. We present four case studies that resolve microparasite impacts on adult salmon migration success, impact of river warming on microparasite replication, and infection status on susceptibility to predation. Future health of wild salmon must be considered in a holistic context that includes the cumulative or synergistic impacts of multiple stressors. These approaches will identify populations at greatest risk, critically needed to manage and potentially ameliorate the shifts in current or future trajectories of wild populations.},

A nine-year study of parasitic sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) and pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) from Pacific Canada indicates that adaptive changes in parasite management on salmon farms have yielded positive conservation outcomes. After four years of sea lice epizootics and wild salmon population decline, parasiticide application on salmon farms was adapted to the timing of wild salmon migrations. Winter treatment of farm fish with parasiticides, prior to the out-migration of wild juvenile salmon, has reduced epizootics of wild salmon without significantly increasing the annual number of treatments. Levels of parasites on wild juvenile salmon significantly influence the growth rate of affected salmon populations, suggesting that these changes in management have had positive outcomes for wild salmon populations. These adaptive changes have not occurred through formal adaptive management, but rather, through multi-stakeholder processes arising from a contentious scientific and public debate. Despite the apparent success of parasite control on salmon farms in the study region, there remain concerns about the long-term sustainability of this approach because of the unknown ecological effects of parasticides and the potential for parasite resistance to chemical treatments.},

	abstract = {The impact of parasites on hosts is invariably negative when considered in isolation, but may be complex and unexpected in nature. For example, if parasites make hosts less desirable to predators then gains from reduced predation may offset direct costs of being parasitized. We explore these ideas in the context of sea louse infestations on salmon. In Pacific Canada, sea lice can spread from farmed salmon to migrating juvenile wild salmon. Low numbers of sea lice can cause mortality of juvenile pink and chum salmon. For pink salmon, this has resulted in reduced productivity of river populations exposed to salmon farming. However, for chum salmon, we did not find an effect of sea louse infestations on productivity, despite high statistical power. Motivated by this unexpected result, we used a mathematical model to show how a parasite-induced shift in predation pressure from chum salmon to pink salmon could offset negative direct impacts of sea lice on chum salmon. This shift in predation is proposed to occur because predators show an innate preference for pink salmon prey. This preference may be more easily expressed when sea lice compromise juvenile salmon hosts, making them easier to catch. Our results indicate how the ecological context of host–parasite interactions may dampen, or even reverse, the expected impact of parasites on host populations.},

In multi-host systems, parasites may mediate food web dynamics with unexpected outcomes for host populations. Models have been used to explore the potential consequences of interactions between hosts, parasites and predators, but connections between theory and data are rare. Here, we consider sea louse parasites (Lepeophtheirus salmonis), which directly increase mortality of juvenile salmon hosts (Oncorhynchus spp.). We use mathematical models and field-based experiments to investigate how the indirect effects of parasitism via predation influence mortality of sympatric juvenile chum salmon (O. keta) and pink salmon (O. gorbuscha). Our experiments show that coho salmon predators (O. kisutch) selectively prey on pink salmon and on parasitized prey. Preference for pink salmon increased slightly when prey were parasitized by sea lice, although there was considerable uncertainty regarding this result. Despite this uncertainty, we show that even the small increase in preference that we observed may be biologically significant. We calculate a critical threshold of pink salmon abundance above which chum salmon may experience a parasite-mediated release from predation as predation shifts towards preferred prey species. This work highlights the importance of considering community interactions, such as predation, when assessing the risk that emerging parasites and pathogens pose to wildlife populations.},

We now recognize that parasites influence species coexistence and extirpation by altering competition, predation, and herbivory, and that these effects can, in turn, influence ecosystem properties. Parasites and pathogens act as ecosystem engineers, alter energy budgets and nutrient cycling, and influence biodiversity. Equally, because ecosystem properties – such as biodiversity – affect parasite populations, there is the potential for feedback between parasitism and ecosystem states. Using examples from animal and plant systems, we examine this potential bidirectional interdependence and challenge the conventional wisdom that parasites have only negative or inconsequential impacts on ecological communities.},

In addition to parasite-modified and apparent competition leading to species exclusion or enabling coexistence, parasites and predators interact in different ways to regulate or destablize the population dynamics of their joint prey. An emerging area is the impact of parasites on intraguild predation (IGP). Parasites can increase vulnerability of infected individuals to cannibalism or predation resulting in reversed species dominance in IGP hierarchies. We discuss the potential significance of parasites for community structure and biodiversity, in particular their role in promoting species exclusion or coexistence and the impact of emerging diseases. Ongoing invasions provide examples where parasites mediate native/invader interactions and play a key role in determining the outcome of invasions. We highlight the need for more quantitative data to assess the impact of parasites on communities, and the combination of theoretical and empirical studies to examine how the effects of parasitism scale up to community-level processes.},

Our goal was to discover and validate gill gene expression biomarkers specific to the hypoxia response in salmonids across multi-stressor conditions. Gill tissue was collected from 24 freshwater juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), held in normoxia [dissolved oxygen (DO) \&gt; 8 mg L-1] and hypoxia (DO = 4‒5 mg L-1) in 10 and 18° temperatures for up to six days. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was then used to discover 240 differentially expressed genes between hypoxic and normoxic conditions, but not affected by temperature. The most significantly differentially expressed genes had functional roles in the cell cycle and suppression of cell proliferation associated with hypoxic conditions. The most significant genes (n = 30) were selected for real-time qPCR assay development. These assays demonstrated a strong correlation (r = 0.88; P \&lt; 0.001) between the expression values from RNA-seq and the fold changes from qPCR. Further, qPCR of the 30 candidate hypoxia biomarkers was applied to an additional 322 Chinook salmon exposed to hypoxic and normoxic conditions to reveal the top biomarkers to define hypoxic stress. Multivariate analyses revealed that smolt stage, water salinity, and morbidity status were relevant factors to consider with the expression of these genes in relation to hypoxic stress. These hypoxia candidate genes will be put into application screening Chinook salmon to determine the identity of stressors impacting the fish.},

	abstract = {An organism's ability to respond effectively to environmental change is critical to its survival. Yet, life stage and overall condition can dictate tolerance thresholds to heightened environmental stressors, such that stress may not be equally felt across individuals and at all times. Also, the transcriptional responses induced by environmental changes can reflect both generalized responses as well as others that are highly specific to the type of change being experienced. Thus, if transcriptional biomarkers specific to a stressor, even under multi-stressor conditions, can be identified, the biomarkers could then be applied in natural environments to determine when and where an individual experiences such a stressor. Here, we experimentally challenged juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) to validate candidate gill gene expression biomarkers. A sophisticated experimental design manipulated salinity (freshwater, brackish water and seawater), temperature (10, 14 and 18°C) and dissolved oxygen (normoxia and hypoxia) in all 18 possible combinations for 6 days using separate trials for three smolt statuses (pre-smolt, smolt and de-smolt). In addition, changes in juvenile behaviour, plasma variables, gill Na+/K+-ATPase activity, body size, body morphology and skin pigmentation supplemented the gene expression responses. We identified biomarkers specific to salinity and temperature that transcended the multiple stressors, smolt status and mortality (live, dead and moribund). Similar biomarkers for dissolved oxygen were not identified. This work demonstrates the unique power of gene expression biomarkers to identify a specific stressor even under multi-stressor conditions, and we discuss our next steps for hypoxia biomarkers using an RNA-seq study.},

	abstract = {Monitoring of marine protected areas (MPAs) is critical for marine ecosystem management, yet current protocols rely on SCUBA-based visual surveys that are costly and time consuming, limiting their scope and effectiveness. Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding is a promising alternative for marine ecosystem monitoring, but more direct comparisons to visual surveys are needed to understand the strengths and limitations of each approach. This study compares fish communities inside and outside the Scorpion State Marine Reserve off Santa Cruz Island, CA using eDNA metabarcoding and underwater visual census surveys. Results from eDNA captured 76\% (19/25) of fish species and 95\% (19/20) of fish genera observed during pairwise underwater visual census. Species missed by eDNA were due to the inability of MiFish 12S barcodes to differentiate species of rockfishes (Sebastes, n = 4) or low site occupancy rates of crevice-dwelling Lythrypnus gobies. However, eDNA detected an additional 23 fish species not recorded in paired visual surveys, but previously reported from prior visual surveys, highlighting the sensitivity of eDNA. Significant variation in eDNA signatures by location (50 m) and site ({\textasciitilde}1000 m) demonstrates the sensitivity of eDNA to address key questions such as community composition inside and outside MPAs. Results demonstrate the utility of eDNA metabarcoding for monitoring marine ecosystems, providing an important complementary tool to visual methods.},

We show that cardiorespiratory physiology varies at the population level among Fraser River sockeye salmon and relates to historical environmental conditions encountered while migrating. Fish from populations with more challenging migratory environments have greater aerobic scope, larger hearts, and better coronary supply. Furthermore, thermal optima for aerobic, cardiac, and heart rate scopes are consistent with the historic river temperature ranges for each population. This study suggests that physiological adaptation occurs at a very local scale, with population-specific thermal limits being set by physiological limitations in aerobic performance, possibly due to cardiac collapse at high temperatures.},

This biocomplexity has enabled the aggregate of populations to sustain its productivity despite major changes in climatic conditions affecting the freshwater and marine environments during the last century. Different geographic and life history components that were minor producers during one climatic regime have dominated during others, emphasizing that the biocomplexity of fish stocks is critical for maintaining their resilience to environmental change.},

Our results indicate that some principles of EBM are being put into practice, but the gap between the scientific literature and management plans suggests that these concepts need to be more effectively translated.

Here we focus on California’s recently collapsed fall-run Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and ask whether portfolio effect induced buffering is observed across the complexity hierarchy from individual populations to populations within a river basin (Sacramento, San Joaquin) to the entire Central Valley. Some buffering was observed when comparing the coefficient of variation in adult returns to a given river basin with its constituent populations but not when comparing returns to the entire Central Valley with its constituent basins because of disproportionately many fish returning to the Sacramento Basin. Moreover, we report that positive correlations in population dynamics between rivers were stronger in the last 25 years of the study compared with the first 25 years. Together, these results suggest evidence of only a weak portfolio effect that has deteriorated in recent years. Nonetheless, we also report that correlations between rivers decreased significantly with distance, suggesting that some biocomplexity remains. Our results suggest that the greatest potential for strengthening the portfolio effect would come through restoration of San Joaquin Basin populations, which at low abundance currently contribute little to the overall buffering capacity despite low cross-basin correlations.},

Local adaptation is defined as a process whereby natural selection increases the frequency of traits within a population that enhance the survival or reproductive success of individuals expressing them. The study of local adaptation in salmonid populations is important because of; (i) its relevance to evolutionary theory; (ii) its role in promoting genetic divergence between populations and the identification of genetic resources of fish; (iii) its potential role in ecological-genetic population “matching” for population rehabilitation programs or in the identification of unique traits of aquacultural significance; and (iv) its role in understanding the diversity of populations and for establishing baseline data for studies designed to investigate ecological-genetic interaction between wild and cultured salmon. A survey of studies is presented which favours the idea that local adaptation is responsible for much of the genetic variation observed among populations in morphological and meristic, behavioural, developmental, physiological and biochemical, and life history traits. Local adaptation is evident both on a broad geographic scale (between populations separated by hundreds of kilometers) and microgeographically (between populations separated by a few kilometers or less) and even between “seasonal races” inhabiting the same habitats. Manipulative experiments could provide valuable information on the potential for, and consequences of changes to adaptive character complexes of wild fish from interbreeding with cultured salmon.},

Such effects of species loss are predicted to be affected by both the number of species lost within a trophic level (horizontal diversity) and the number of trophic levels lost (vertical diversity). We experimentally manipulated horizontal and vertical diversity within an aquatic insect community, and examined responses throughout the food web. Horizontal and vertical diversity both impacted ciliates: reduction of detritivorous insect diversity resulted in secondary extinctions and decreased density of ciliates, but only when an insect predator was simultaneously absent. Horizontal and vertical diversity differed in their effect on other foodweb processes, including detrital processing, predator growth, and densities of rotifers, flagellates and flatworms. These results caution that foodweb effects of multitrophic species loss may not be reliably predicted from manipulations of just one dimension of diversity.},

	abstract = {Current species extinction rates are at unprecedentedly high levels. While human activities can be the direct cause of some extinctions, it is becoming increasingly clear that species extinctions themselves can be the cause of further extinctions, since species affect each other through the network of ecological interactions among them. There is concern that the simplification of ecosystems, due to the loss of species and ecological interactions, increases their vulnerability to such secondary extinctions. It is predicted that more complex food webs will be less vulnerable to secondary extinctions due to greater trophic redundancy that can buffer against the effects of species loss. Here, we demonstrate in a field experiment with replicated plant-insect communities, that the probability of secondary extinctions is indeed smaller in food webs that include trophic redundancy. Harvesting one species of parasitoid wasp led to secondary extinctions of other, indirectly linked, species at the same trophic level. This effect was markedly stronger in simple communities than for the same species within a more complex food web. We show that this is due to functional redundancy in the more complex food webs and confirm this mechanism with a food web simulation model by highlighting the importance of the presence and strength of trophic links providing redundancy to those links that were lost. Our results demonstrate that biodiversity loss, leading to a reduction in redundant interactions, can increase the vulnerability of ecosystems to secondary extinctions, which, when they occur, can then lead to further simplification and run-away extinction cascades.},

Ecologists have investigated both the influence of environmental variables on species diversity and the influence of species diversity on ecosystem function and stability. These investigations have largely been carried out without taking into account the overarching stabilizing structures of food webs that arise from evolutionary and successional processes and that are maintained through species interactions. Here, we argue that the same large-scale structures that have been purported to convey stability to food webs can also help to understand both the distribution of species diversity in nature and the relationship between species diversity and food web stability. Specifically, the allocation of species diversity to slow energy channels within food webs results in the skewed distribution of interactions strengths that has been shown to confer stability to complex food webs. We end by discussing the processes that might generate and maintain the structured, stable and diverse food webs observed in nature.},

The elimination of the bass was followed by a dramatic increase in the density of planktivorous fish, the disappearance of large zooplankton (e.g., two species of Daphnia that had historically dominated the zooplankton community), and the appearance of a suite of small-bodied cladoceran (zooplankton) species. The system remained in this state until bass were reintroduced. As the bass population increased, the system showed a steady and predictable return to its previous state; planktivore numbers declined by two orders of magnitude, large-bodied Daphnia reappeared and again dominated the zooplankton, and the suite of small-bodied cladocerans disappeared. Within each cladoceran species there was a steady increase in mean adult body size as planktivore numbers declined. Total zooplankton biomass increased ≈ 10-fold following the return of large-bodied Daphnia, and water clarity increased significantly with increases in Daphnia biomass and total cladoceran biomass. These changes in community structure and trophic-level biomasses demonstrate the strong impact of removing a single, keystone species, and the capacity of the community to return to its previous state after the species is reintroduced.},

Although theory predicts that both will strongly alter the distribution of biomass in whole communities, empirical evidence has not been consolidated to quantitatively determine whether these theoretical predictions are generally borne out in real ecosystems. Here we analyze data from two types of trophic cascade studies, predator removals in factorial combination with fertilization and observed productivity gradients, to assess the role of top-down and bottom-up forces in structuring multi-trophic communities and compare results from these analyses to those from an extensive database of trophic cascade studies. We find that herbivore biomass declines and plant biomass increases in the presence of predators, regardless of system productivity. In contrast, while plants are increased by fertilization, this effect does not significantly increase herbivores in either the presence or absence of predators. These patterns are consistent among marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems and are largely independent of study size and duration. Thus, top-down effects of predation are transferred through more trophic levels than are bottom-up effects of eutrophication, showing strong asymmetry in the direction of control of biomass distribution in communities.},

Instead, dependent parasites, commensals, and mutualist partners (affiliates) face the risk of coextinction as their hosts or partners decline and fail. Species interactions in ecological networks can transmit the effects of primary extinctions within and between trophic levels, causing secondary extinctions and extinction cascades. Documenting coextinctions is complicated by ignorance of host specificity, limitations of historical collections, incomplete systematics of affiliate taxa, and lack of experimental studies. Host shifts may reduce the rate of coextinctions, but they are poorly understood. In the absence of better empirical records of coextinctions, statistical models estimate the rates of past and future coextinctions, and based on primary extinctions and interactions among species, network models explore extinction cascades. Models predict and historical evidence reveals that the threat of coextinction is influenced by both host and affiliate traits and is exacerbated by other threats, including habitat loss, climate change, and invasive species.},

Even though a complete appreciation of the effects of perturbations on ecosystems requires the simultaneous measurement of these multiple components of stability, most ecological research has focused on one or a few of those components analysed in isolation. Here, we present a new view of ecological stability that recognises explicitly the non-independence of components of stability. This provides an approach for simplifying the concept of stability. We illustrate the concept and approach using results from a field experiment, and show that the effective dimensionality of ecological stability is considerably lower than if the various components of stability were unrelated. However, strong perturbations can modify, and even decouple, relationships among individual components of stability. Thus, perturbations not only increase the dimensionality of stability but they can also alter the relationships among components of stability in different ways. Studies that focus on single forms of stability in isolation therefore risk underestimating significantly the potential of perturbations to destabilise ecosystems. In contrast, application of the multidimensional stability framework that we propose gives a far richer understanding of how communities respond to perturbations.},

Whether and how quickly communities recover from such pulses is central to our understanding of biodiversity dynamics and ecosystem organisation, but also to nature conservation and management. Here, we present a meta-analysis of 508 (semi-)natural field experiments globally distributed across marine, terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. We found recovery to be significant yet incomplete. At the end of the experiments, disturbed treatments resembled controls again when considering abundance (94\%), biomass (82\%), and univariate diversity measures (88\%). Most disturbed treatments did not further depart from control after the pulse, indicating that few studies showed novel trajectories induced by the pulse. Only multivariate community composition on average showed little recovery: disturbed species composition remained dissimilar to the control throughout most experiments. Still, when experiments revealed a higher compositional stability, they tended to also show higher functional stability. Recovery was more complete when systems had high resistance, whereas resilience and resistance were negatively correlated. The overall results were highly consistent across studies, but significant differences between ecosystems and organism groups appeared. Future research on disturbances should aim to understand these differences, but also fill obvious gaps in the empirical assessments for regions (especially the tropics), ecosystems and organisms. In summary, we provide general evidence that (semi-)natural communities can recover from pulse disturbances, but compositional aspects are more vulnerable to long-lasting effects of pulse disturbance than the emergent functions associated to them.},

	abstract = {Global fisheries landings ceased increasing decades ago, causing an increasing shortfall in wild seafood supply and an expansion of aquaculture. The abundance of domesticated fishes now dwarfs related wild fishes in some coastal seas, changing the dynamics of their infectious diseases. Transport and trade of seafood, feed, eggs, and broodstock bring pathogens into new regions and into contact with naïve hosts. Density-dependent transmission creates threshold effects where disease can abruptly switch from endemic to epizootic dynamics. Hydrodynamics allow pathogens to disperse broadly, interconnecting farms into metapopulations of domesticated host fish in regions that also support related species of wild fish. Spillover and spillback dynamics of pathogen transmission between wild and farmed fish can create novel transmission pathways or bioamplify pathogen abundance, potentially depressing or endangering wild fish. Mortality from natural predator–prey interactions may be synergistic or compensatory with these increased infections. Domestic environments may favour the evolution of undesirable pathogen traits, such as virulence and drug resistance, leading to the emergence of strains that cause high mortality and (or) evade treatment. Overall, these changes to the dynamics of infectious disease in coastal seas impose new constraints on the sustainability of both wild and farmed fish.},

In multi-host systems, parasites may mediate food web dynamics with unexpected outcomes for host populations. Models have been used to explore the potential consequences of interactions between hosts, parasites and predators, but connections between theory and data are rare. Here, we consider sea louse parasites (Lepeophtheirus salmonis), which directly increase mortality of juvenile salmon hosts (Oncorhynchus spp.). We use mathematical models and field-based experiments to investigate how the indirect effects of parasitism via predation influence mortality of sympatric juvenile chum salmon (O. keta) and pink salmon (O. gorbuscha). Our experiments show that coho salmon predators (O. kisutch) selectively prey on pink salmon and on parasitized prey. Preference for pink salmon increased slightly when prey were parasitized by sea lice, although there was considerable uncertainty regarding this result. Despite this uncertainty, we show that even the small increase in preference that we observed may be biologically significant. We calculate a critical threshold of pink salmon abundance above which chum salmon may experience a parasite-mediated release from predation as predation shifts towards preferred prey species. This work highlights the importance of considering community interactions, such as predation, when assessing the risk that emerging parasites and pathogens pose to wildlife populations.},

	abstract = {Water quality degradation due to lake eutrophication and climate change contributes to the risk of extirpation for the endangered Cultus Lake sockeye salmon. Sockeye salmon juveniles experience both low-oxygen water in profundal lake habitats and elevated temperatures above the thermocline during diel vertical migrations in summer and fall when the lake is thermally stratified. We used a transcriptomic tool (Salmon Fit-Chip) to determine whether salmon were experiencing thermal and/or hypoxic stress during this period. The results showed that over one-third of the fish were responding to either hypoxic (35.5\%) or thermal stress (40.9\%) during periods when these environmental stressors were pronounced within the lake, but not during periods when profundal dissolved oxygen was elevated and the water column was isothermal and cool. The most consistent signs of hypoxic stress occurred during July (52.2\%) and September (44.4\%). A total of 25.7\% of individual fish sampled during months when both stressors were occurring (July, September, October) showed signatures of both stressors. When a combination of hypoxic and thermal stress biomarkers was applied, 92\% of fish showed evidence of one or both stressors; hence, for at least several months of the year, most sockeye salmon juveniles in Cultus Lake are experiencing anthropogenically environmentally induced stress. We also detected the presence of pathogenic ciliate Ichthyoptherius multifiliis in the gill tissue of juveniles, with a higher infection signal in Cultus Lake compared to juveniles from nearby Chilliwack Lake. These data provide powerful new evidence that Cultus Lake sockeye salmon, which experience relatively lower juvenile survival than Chilliwack sockeye salmon, are more compromised by stress and carry a higher level of infection of at least one pathogenic agent. Thus, we hypothesize that the cumulative or synergistic interplay between stressors and diseases, clearly documented to be occurring within Cultus Lake, are contributing to increased mortality of endangered sockeye salmon.},

We found that the decline could be attributed to a declining trend in productivity likely related to changing ocean conditions, overfishing, and freshwater habitat alteration. Among individual watersheds, rates of decline in adult coho salmon abundance were correlated with agricultural land use, road density, and a qualitative measure of stream habitat status but not with the proportion of land recently logged. The recovery of these populations will require the prudent regulation of fishing, the restoration of salmon producing watersheds, and an improvement in ocean conditions.},

We examined the proportion of Yukon River Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha) exhibiting evidence of heat stress to assess the potential that high temperatures contribute to freshwater adult mortality in a northern Pacific salmon population. Water temperatures greater than 18 °C have occurred almost annually in the Yukon River and correspond with low population abundance since the 1990s. Using gene transcription products and heat shock protein 70 biomarkers validated by field experiment, we identified heat stress in half of Chinook salmon examined (54\%, n = 477) across three mainstem locations and three tributaries in 2016–2017. Biomarkers tracked wide variation in water temperature (14–23 °C) within a tributary. The proportion of salmon with heat stress differed between years at four of the six locations, with more prevalent heat stress in the warmer year. This work demonstrates that warming water temperatures are currently affecting northern populations of Pacific salmon.},

Collectively, these measures encapsulate the overall ‘stability’ of the system. Many international bodies, including the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, broadly aspire to maintain or enhance ecological stability. Such bodies frequently use terms pertaining to stability that lack clear definition. Consequently, we cannot measure them and so they disconnect from a large body of theoretical and empirical understanding. We assess the scientific and policy literature and show that this disconnect is one consequence of an inconsistent and one-dimensional approach that ecologists have taken to both disturbances and stability. This has led to confused communication of the nature of stability and the level of our insight into it. Disturbances and stability are multidimensional. Our understanding of them is not. We have a remarkably poor understanding of the impacts on stability of the characteristics that define many, perhaps all, of the most important elements of global change. We provide recommendations for theoreticians, empiricists and policymakers on how to better integrate the multidimensional nature of ecological stability into their research, policies and actions.},

There has been a profusion of metrics proposed to quantify stability, of which only a handful are used commonly. Furthermore, studies typically quantify one to two metrics of stability at a time and in response to a single perturbation, with some of the main environmental pressures of today being the least studied. We argue that we need to build on the existing consensus and strong theoretical foundation of the stability concept to better understand its multidimensionality and the interdependencies between metrics, levels of organisation and types of perturbations. Only by doing so can we make progress in the quantification of stability in theory and in practice, and eventually build a more comprehensive understanding of how ecosystems will respond to ongoing environmental change.},

As such, conservation actions which only target single-threat drivers risk being inadequate because of the cascading effects caused by unmanaged synergies.

In 1973, Robert May addressed these questions in this classic book. May investigated the mathematical roots of population dynamics and argued-counter to most current biological thinking-that complex ecosystems in themselves do not lead to population stability. Stability and Complexity in Model Ecosystems played a key role in introducing nonlinear mathematical models and the study of deterministic chaos into ecology, a role chronicled in James Gleick's book Chaos. In the quarter century since its first publication, the book's message has grown in power. Nonlinear models are now at the center of ecological thinking, and current threats to biodiversity have made questions about the role of ecosystem complexity more crucial than ever. In a new introduction, the author addresses some of the changes that have swept biology and the biological world since the book's first publication.},

This can, in turn, alter interaction strengths among species and modify community composition. However, the relative importance of such behaviours in determining the structure of complex communities is unknown. Here we show that single-locus changes affecting biofilm formation phenotypes in Bacillus subtilis modify community structure to the same extent as loss of an apex predator and even to a greater extent than loss of B. subtilis itself. These results, from experimentally manipulated multitrophic microcosm assemblages, demonstrate that bacterial social traits are key modulators of the structure of their communities. Moreover, they show that intraspecific genetic variability can be as important as strong trophic interactions in determining community dynamics. Microevolution may therefore be as important as species extinctions in shaping the response of microbial communities to environmental change.},

	abstract = {The fact that genetic traits in one species can affect an entire ecosystem has important basic and applied implications that are only now being appreciated. The potential sphere of gene influence can be expanded from the individual and population level (that is, population genetics) to the higher levels included in community and ecosystem genetics. When this is done new fields of study are likely to emerge, such as community and ecosystem genomics.Just as the genotype has a 'traditional' phenotype that is expressed in the individual and population, its expression could also extend to levels higher than the population, to produce community and ecosystem phenotypes.Using traditional population and quantitative genetics methods we show that these community and ecosystem phenotypes are heritable and that some are likely to feed back to affect the fitness of the tree.These combined effects provide a mechanism for exploring the controversial issue of community and ecosystem evolution (that is, the change in genetic interactions between species over time).We show how a mapped trait in a common tree predictably affects the structure and composition of the arthropod community in the canopy of the tree, the microbial community in the soil, the detritivore community in an adjacent stream, the foraging of a mammalian herbivore, and the interactions of different trophic levels. In turn, these interactions predictably affect important ecosystem processes such as litter decomposition and nitrogen mineralization.Future studies will need to evaluate how genetic changes in foundation species — brought about by exotic introductions, genetic engineering and climate change — will result in new community and ecosystem phenotypes. These new phenotypes can affect community structure, biodiversity and fundamental ecosystem processes such as nutrient cycling.},

	abstract = {Small habitat patches have been historically neglected in conservation, primarily because extinction risk is higher in small patches. Nevertheless, sets of small patches usually harbor more species than one or a few larger patches of equal total area. Resolving this inconsistency is key to policy and practice in biodiversity conservation. Our analysis of 32 datasets (603 patches and 2290 taxa) provides two novel lines of evidence confirming that small patches have disproportionately high value for biodiversity. First, sets of small patches harbor more species than large patches even when considering only species of conservation concern. Second, sets of small patches harbor more species than large patches even when the small patches are very small compared to the large patches. Therefore, higher extinction risk in small than large patches does not decrease the cumulative value of small patches for biodiversity. We contend that acknowledging the conservation value of small patches, even very small patches, will be a necessary step for stemming biodiversity loss in the Anthropocene.},

Fahrig concluded that to date there is no empirical evidence supporting the widespread assumption that a group of small habitat patches generally has lower ecological value than large patches of the same total area. Fletcher et al. (2018) dispute this conclusion, arguing that the literature to date indicates generally negative ecological effects of habitat fragmentation per se. They base their argument largely on extrapolation from patch-scale patterns and mechanisms (effects of patch size and isolation, and edge effects) to landscape-scale effects of habitat fragmentation. We argue that such extrapolation is unreliable because: (1) it ignores other mechanisms, especially those acting at landscape scales (e.g., increased habitat diversity, spreading of risk, landscape complementation) that can counteract effects of the documented patch-scale mechanisms; and (2) extrapolation of a small-scale mechanism to a large-scale pattern is not evidence of that pattern but, rather a prediction that must be tested at the larger scale. Such tests were the subject of Fahrig's review. We find no support for Fletcher et al.'s claim that biases in Fahrig's review would alter its conclusions. We encourage further landscape-scale empirical studies of effects of habitat fragmentation per se, and research aimed at uncovering the mechanisms that underlie positive fragmentation effects.},

	abstract = {Although groups of small habitat patches often support more species than large patches of equal total area, their biodiversity value remains controversial. An important line of evidence in this debate compares species accumulation curves, where patches are ordered from small–large and large–small (aka ‘SLOSS analysis’). However, this method counts species equally and is unable to distinguish patch size dependence in species’ occupancies. Moreover, because of the species–area relationship, richness differences typically only contribute to accumulation in small–large order, maximizing the probability of adding species in this direction. Using a null model to control for this, I tested 202 published datasets from archipelagos, habitat islands and fragments for patch size dependence in species accumulation and compared conclusions regarding relative species accumulation with SLOSS analysis. Relative to null model expectations, species accumulation was on average 2.7\% higher in large–small than small–large order. The effect was strongest in archipelagos (5\%), intermediate for fragments (1.5\%) and smallest for habitat islands (1.1\%). There was no difference in effect size among taxonomic groups, but each shared this same trend. Results suggest most meta-communities include species that either prefer, or depend upon, larger habitat patches. Relative to SLOSS analysis, null models found lower frequency of greater small-patch importance for species representation (e.g., for fragments: 69 vs 16\% respectively) and increased frequency for large patches (fragments: 3 vs 25\%). I suggest SLOSS analysis provides unreliable inference on species accumulation and the outcome largely depends on island species–area relationships, not the relative diversity value of small vs large patches.},

	abstract = {Aim Quinn \& Harrison (1988; Oecologia, 75, 132) suggested that several small, isolated islands generally bore a higher diversity than fewer (or single) larger islands. They proposed a method by which the cumulative diversity of islands arranged small-to-large (‘STOL’) and large-to-small (‘LTOS’) could be used to identify how island area and species distributions interact to produce the system-wide or ensemble diversity. From these curves, an ‘index of saturation’ (SI) was calculated to summarize the way in which diversity is generated on a given archipelago. Unfortunately, the method did not allow statistical judgements to be made. Our paper considers the reliability of the Quinn-Harrison approach, especially in light of the inconsistency of its implications compared with ‘nestedness’ analyses. Location Three example data sets are used: reptiles from the archipelagos of the Sea of Cortéz, breeding land-birds from the Canary Islands, and stream invertebrates occupying rocks in the Steavenson River of central Victoria, Australia. Methods We refine the Quinn-Harrison technique to produce a method by which the difference between the STOL and LTOS cumulative diversity curves can be gauged statistically (the ξ statistic). We also propose an alternative statistic (η)—which we believe to be more intuitive—that preferentially weights species occurring on few patches and that can be statistically assessed by using Monte Carlo simulation. Results The basic Quinn-Harrison technique is not reliable for diagnosing whether systems are characterized by STOL or LTOS patterns. The three example data sets provide the range of options for faunal-diversity generation (STOL overlies LTOS, LTOS overlies STOL, and coincident). However, statistical analyses indicate that the patterns all are generated by the rarer species occupying larger islands. The results of the revised ξ statistic and especially the η statistic are consistent with this deduction, which in turn relate well with faunal-nestedness analyses. Main conclusions There was a contradiction between the Quinn-Harrison analyses, which suggested that most rarer taxa occurred in impoverished, smaller islands, and results of nestedness analyses, which indicated that the rarer taxa occurred on more speciose, larger islands. The resolution to this dilemma is that the Quinn-Harrison diagram and saturation index are so flawed that they yield unreliable results vis a vis the generation of diversity on archipelagos.},

	abstract = {Several small habitat patches typically contain more species than a single large patch of comparable area. This pattern has fueled controversy over reserve design (the SLOSS debate); yet its causes remain poorly understood, limiting discussion of any broader biodiversity implications. Using 44 published faunal metacommunity datasets from fragments, islands and habitat islands, we test four hypotheses to explain differences in species richness (SRd) between several small patches and a single large patch: (i) beta diversity (BD); (ii) evenness of species abundance distributions (EV); (iii) size bias in sampling efficiency (SE); and (iv) taxonomy. We used individual-based null models and confirmatory path analysis to compare direct and indirect support for these non-exclusive hypotheses. Broad taxonomic grouping (invertebrates {\textgreater} birds = non-volant vertebrates) accounted for most of the variation in SRd, while BD, EV and SE had smaller, but comparable, direct effects (standardized coefficients = 0.42, 0.31 and −0.26 respectively). Within a taxonomic group, larger SRd occurred when both BD and EV increase. Although sampling bias probably overstates the difference in SRd, it does not explain the pattern. Beyond reserve design, the SLOSS pattern implies potential principles for managing biodiversity in fragmented landscapes. Whether this pattern should inform conservation requires greater understanding. We confirm beta diversity is the major contributor, but it is mediated by increases and decreases in evenness among small patches. Attention to how sub-division alters relative abundances (e.g., by biotic relaxation or altering competitive outcomes) might help clarify how the SLOSS pattern arises.},

	abstract = {Although habitat loss is the predominant factor leading to biodiversity loss in the Anthropocene1,2, exactly how this loss manifests—and at which scales—remains a central debate3–6. The ‘passive sampling’ hypothesis suggests that species are lost in proportion to their abundance and distribution in the natural habitat7,8, whereas the ‘ecosystem decay’ hypothesis suggests that ecological processes change in smaller and more-isolated habitats such that more species are lost than would have been expected simply through loss of habitat alone9,10. Generalizable tests of these hypotheses have been limited by heterogeneous sampling designs and a narrow focus on estimates of species richness that are strongly dependent on scale. Here we analyse 123 studies of assemblage-level abundances of focal taxa taken from multiple habitat fragments of varying size to evaluate the influence of passive sampling and ecosystem decay on biodiversity loss. We found overall support for the ecosystem decay hypothesis. Across all studies, ecosystems and taxa, biodiversity estimates from smaller habitat fragments—when controlled for sampling effort—contain fewer individuals, fewer species and less-even communities than expected from a sample of larger fragments. However, the diversity loss due to ecosystem decay in some studies (for example, those in which habitat loss took place more than 100 years ago) was less than expected from the overall pattern, as a result of compositional turnover by species that were not originally present in the intact habitats. We conclude that the incorporation of non-passive effects of habitat loss on biodiversity change will improve biodiversity scenarios under future land use, and planning for habitat protection and restoration.},

Diurnal and nocturnal line-transect sampling was used for censusing mammals{\textgreater}1 kg body weight, and the relative abundance of species in the six fragments was compared. The number of mammal species recorded in the reserves was strongly related to the forest area, the richest community being recorded in the two large reserves and the poorest in the two small reserves. The large reserves had a structurally more complex community, with top predators, large, terrestrial frugivores and large myrmecophages. The mammal community of the small and the medium-sized reserves was impoverished and less complex. Frugivores were numerically predominant in both large and medium-sized reserves, whereas herbivores dominated the mammal community of the small reserves, mainly through the absence of agoutis Dasyprocta leporina and the high density of maned sloth Bradypus torquatus in the two small reserves. The lack of predators and the proliferation of secondary vegetation and lianas throughout the small reserves are probably the main causes for the success of arboreal folivores there. Illegal hunting was found to reduce the encounter rates of mostly large, terrestrial frugivores such as agoutis, pacas Agouti paca, peccaries Pecari tajacu and Tayassu pecari and deer Mazama spp., and is contributing to keep the population of the surviving species low.},

	abstract = {Habitat loss is a primary threat to biodiversity across the planet, yet contentious debate has ensued on the importance of habitat fragmentation ‘per se’ (i.e., altered spatial configuration of habitat for a given amount of habitat loss). Based on a review of landscape-scale investigations, Fahrig (2017; Ecological responses to habitat fragmentation per se. Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics 48:1-23) reports that biodiversity responses to habitat fragmentation ‘per se’ are more often positive rather than negative and concludes that the widespread belief in negative fragmentation effects is a ‘zombie idea’. We show that Fahrig's conclusions are drawn from a narrow and potentially biased subset of available evidence, which ignore much of the observational, experimental and theoretical evidence for negative effects of altered habitat configuration. We therefore argue that Fahrig's conclusions should be interpreted cautiously as they could be misconstrued by policy makers and managers, and we provide six arguments why they should not be applied in conservation decision-making. Reconciling the scientific disagreement, and informing conservation more effectively, will require research that goes beyond statistical and correlative approaches. This includes a more prudent use of data and conceptual models that appropriately partition direct vs indirect influences of habitat loss and altered spatial configuration, and more clearly discriminate the mechanisms underpinning any changes. Incorporating these issues will deliver greater mechanistic understanding and more predictive power to address the conservation issues arising from habitat loss and fragmentation.},

	abstract = {Background The principle that a single large habitat patch should hold more species than several small patches totalling the same area (SL {\textgreater} SS) is used by conservation agencies to favour protection of large, contiguous areas. Previous reviews of empirical studies have found the opposite, SS {\textgreater} SL, creating the single large or several small (SLOSS) debate. Aims Review the empirical and theoretical SLOSS literature; identify potential mechanisms underlying the SS {\textgreater} SL pattern; evaluate these where possible. Location Global. Time period 1976–2018. Major taxa Plants, invertebrates, vertebrates. Methods Literature review. Results Like previous reviews, I found that SS {\textgreater} SL dominates empirical findings. This pattern remained, although it was somewhat weakened, in studies where sampling intensity was proportional to patch size. I found six classes of theory, and conducted five preliminary evaluations of theory. None of the predictions was supported. The SS {\textgreater} SL pattern held for specialist species groups, suggesting it does not result from incursion by generalists into small patches. I found no evidence for the prediction that the reverse pattern (SL {\textgreater} SS) becomes more common over time since patch creation, through gradual species losses from SS. I found no difference between results for natural and anthropogenic patches. There was also no evidence for predictions that SL {\textgreater} SS is more common when the matrix is more hostile, or for stable than ephemeral patches. Main conclusions Most empirical comparisons find SS {\textgreater} SL. While there are several potential causes, more empirical work is needed to identify those at play. Meanwhile, conservation practitioners should understand that there is no ecological evidence supporting a general principle to preserve large, contiguous habitat areas rather than multiple small areas of the same total size.},

	abstract = {An analytical model of competitive coexistence in spatial habitats, modified to address habitat destruction, predicts that the most abundant species can be among the first species driven extinct by habitat destruction, given that abundant species are the poorest dispersers and best competitors. This contrasts with the classical view of biased extinction of rare species. Here we explore the robustness of this prediction both analytically and in spatially explicit simulations of more realistic cases. The prediction proved surprisingly robust. The poorest dispersers, which in this model generally are the best competitors and may be the most abundant species, were among the first driven extinct by habitat destruction whether they were abundant or rare, had short or long range dispersal, or reproduced continuously or periodically; whether competitive displacement was immediate or gradual; whether habitat destruction was clumped, uniform, or random and whether destruction occurred at once or progressively; and whether the habitat was large or small. The amount of destruction sufficient to produce extinctions changed considerably as model assumptions changed, but the biased extinction remained. The underlying reason for the robustness of our conclusions is the broad assumption that inferior competitors persist by virtue of greater dispersal ability and/or lower mortality rates. Further work on the forces allowing multispecies coexistence is thus essential for understanding the effects of habitat destruction on extinction.},

	abstract = {For this article, I reviewed empirical studies finding significant ecological responses to habitat fragmentation per se—in other words, significant responses to fragmentation independent of the effects of habitat amount (hereafter referred to as habitat fragmentation). I asked these two questions: Are most significant responses to habitat fragmentation negative or positive? And do particular attributes of species or landscapes lead to a predominance of negative or positive significant responses? I found 118 studies reporting 381 significant responses to habitat fragmentation independent of habitat amount. Of these responses, 76\% were positive. Most significant fragmentation effects were positive, irrespective of how the authors controlled for habitat amount, the measure of fragmentation, the taxonomic group, the type of response variable, or the degree of specialization or conservation status of the species or species group. No support was found for predictions that most significant responses to fragmentation should be negative in the tropics, for species with larger movement ranges, or when habitat amount is low; most significant fragmentation effects were positive in all of these cases. Thus, although 24\% of significant responses to habitat fragmentation were negative, I found no conditions in which most responses were negative. Authors suggest a wide range of possible explanations for significant positive responses to habitat fragmentation: increased functional connectivity, habitat diversity, positive edge effects, stability of predator–prey/host–parasitoid systems, reduced competition, spreading of risk, and landscape complementation. A consistent preponderance of positive significant responses to fragmentation implies that there is no justification for assigning lower conservation value to a small patch than to an equivalent area within a large patch—instead, it implies just the opposite. This finding also suggests that land sharing will usually provide higher ecological value than land sparing.},

Dominant species often are considered to be free of this threat because they are abundant in the undisturbed fragments that remain after destruction.

Even moderate habitat destruction is predicted to cause time-delayed but deterministic extinction of the dominant competitor in remnant patches. Further species are predicted to become extinct, in order from the best to the poorest competitors, as habitat destruction increases. More-over, the more fragmented a habitat already is, the greater is the number of extinctions caused by added destruction. Because such extinctions occur generations after fragmentation, they represent a debt—a future ecological cost of current habitat destruction.},

	abstract = {I challenge (1) the assumption that habitat patches are natural units of measurement for species richness, and (2) the assumption of distinct effects of habitat patch size and isolation on species richness. I propose a simpler view of the relationship between habitat distribution and species richness, the ‘habitat amount hypothesis’, and I suggest ways of testing it. The habitat amount hypothesis posits that, for habitat patches in a matrix of non-habitat, the patch size effect and the patch isolation effect are driven mainly by a single underlying process, the sample area effect. The hypothesis predicts that species richness in equal-sized sample sites should increase with the total amount of habitat in the ‘local landscape’ of the sample site, where the local landscape is the area within an appropriate distance of the sample site. It also predicts that species richness in a sample site is independent of the area of the particular patch in which the sample site is located (its ‘local patch’), except insofar as the area of that patch contributes to the amount of habitat in the local landscape of the sample site. The habitat amount hypothesis replaces two predictor variables, patch size and isolation, with a single predictor variable, habitat amount, when species richness is analysed for equal-sized sample sites rather than for unequal-sized habitat patches. Studies to test the hypothesis should ensure that ‘habitat’ is correctly defined, and the spatial extent of the local landscape is appropriate, for the species group under consideration. If supported, the habitat amount hypothesis would mean that to predict the relationship between habitat distribution and species richness: (1) distinguishing between patch-scale and landscape-scale habitat effects is unnecessary; (2) distinguishing between patch size effects and patch isolation effects is unnecessary; (3) considering habitat configuration independent of habitat amount is unnecessary; and (4) delineating discrete habitat patches is unnecessary.},

However, over half the global protected-area inventory is composed of protected areas that are {\textless}100 ha, and the median size of added protected area is decreasing. Studies of the conservation value of small reserves and fragments of natural area are relatively uncommon in the literature. We reviewed SCOPUS and WOK for studies on small reserve and fragment contributions to biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services, and fifty-eight taxon-specific studies were included in the review. Small reserves harbored substantial portions (upward of 50\%) of regional species diversity for many taxa (birds, plants, amphibians, and small mammals) and even some endemic, specialist bird species. Unfortunately, small reserves and fragments almost always harbored more generalist and exotic species than large reserves. Community composition depended on habitat quality, surrounding land use (agricultural vs. urban), and reserve and fragment size, which presents opportunities for management and improvement. Small reserves also provided ecosystem services, such as pollination and biological pest control, and cultural services, such as recreation and improved human health. Limitations associated with small reserves, such as extinction debt and support of area-sensitive species, necessitate a complement of larger reserves. However, we argue that small reserves can make viable and significant contributions to conservation goals directly as habitat and indirectly by increasing landscape connectivity and quality to the benefit of large reserves. To effectively conserve biodiversity for future generations in landscapes fragmented by human development, small reserves and fragments must be included in conservation planning.},

	abstract = {There has been much debate about the effectiveness of different sized reserves for nature conservation. However, in human-dominated landscapes such as cities, conservation reserve systems are, by necessity, often determined without using conservation planning principles. This can result in reserve systems that are small, fragmented and disconnected. In this study, we conducted a floristic survey of 68 urban grassland conservation reserves to assess how reserves of different areas contribute to species conservation. Species accumulation curves, species-area relationships, and proportion of native cover were explored. We found that 87\% of all native plant species were found in small reserves {\textless}10ha in size, more small reserves contained a greater number of species than few large reserves of a comparable area, and cover of native species in small reserves was no different than cover in large reserves. However, large reserves harboured more uncommon species than smaller reserves. This research has several important implications for conservation planning and design, highlighting that both small and large reserves can help to conserve native plant species in urban areas. However, a preference for large reserves over small ones is embedded in much conservation planning and management. There is a danger that a normative belief that large reserves are ‘good’ and small reserves are ‘bad’ has become entrenched in conservation thinking. While the theory and evidence showing the conservation benefits of large reserves over small reserves for some organisms is clear, in some cases, small reserves can make a substantial and genuine contribution to conservation outcomes.},

While the widespread use of model selection using information criteria has pushed ecology toward placing a higher emphasis on prediction, few attempts have been made to validate the ability of information criteria to correctly identify the most parsimonious model with the greatest predictive accuracy. Here, we used an ecological forecasting framework to test the ability of information criteria to accurately predict the relative contribution of density dependence and density-independent factors (forage availability, harvest, weather, wolf [Canis lupus] density) on inter-annual fluctuations in beaver (Castor canadensis) colony densities. We modeled changes in colony densities using a discrete-time Gompertz model, and assessed the performance of four models using information criteria values: density-independent models with (1) and without (2) environmental covariates; and density-dependent models with (3) and without (4) environmental covariates. We then evaluated the forecasting accuracy of each model by withholding the final one-third of observations from each population and compared observed vs. predicted densities. Information criteria and our forecasting accuracy metrics both provided strong evidence of compensatory density dependence in the annual dynamics of beaver colony densities. However, despite strong within-sample performance by the most complex model (density-dependent with covariates) as determined using information criteria, hindcasts of colony densities revealed that the much simpler density-dependent model without covariates performed nearly as well predicting out-of-sample colony densities. The hindcast results indicated that the complex model over-fit our data, suggesting that parameters identified by information criteria as important predictor variables are only marginally valuable for predicting landscape-scale beaver colony dynamics. Our study demonstrates the importance of evaluating ecological models and predictions with long-term data and revealed how a known limitation of information criteria (over-fitting of complex models) can affect our interpretation of ecological dynamics. While incorporating knowledge of the factors that influence animal population dynamics can improve population forecasts, we suggest that comparing forecast performance metrics can likewise improve our knowledge of the factors driving population dynamics.},

Recent advances in island biogeography may provide a detailed basis for understanding what to expect of such a system of reserves. The main conclusions are as follows: The number of species that a reserve can hold at equilibrium is a function of its area and its isolation. Larger reserves, and reserves located close to other reserves, can hold more species. If most of the area of a habitat is destroyed, and a fraction of the area is saved as a reserve, the reserve will initially contain more species than it can hold at equilibrium. The excess will gradually go extinct. The smaller the reserve, the higher will be the extinction rates. Estimates of these extinction rates for bird and mammal species have recently become available in a few cases. Different species require different minimum areas to have a reasonable chance of survival. Some geometric design principles are suggested in order to optimise the function of reserves in saving species.},

Here, we employ spatially explicit simulations of large numbers of species in spatially heterogeneous landscapes to investigate SARs and extinctions in a dynamic context. The EAR gives the number of species going extinct immediately after habitat loss, but typically many other species have unviable populations in the remaining habitat and go extinct soon afterwards. We conclude that the EAR underestimates extinctions due to habitat loss, the continental SAR (with slope 0.1 or somewhat less) gives a good approximation of short-term extinctions, while the island SAR calculated for discrete fragments of habitat (with slope 0.25) predicts the long-term extinctions. However, when the remaining area of land-covering habitat such as forest is roughly less than 20\% of the total landscape and the habitat is highly fragmented, all current SARs underestimate extinction rate. We show how the ‘fragmentation effect’ can be incorporated into a predictive SAR model. When the remaining habitat is highly fragmented, an effective way to combat the fragmentation effect is to aggregate habitat fragments into clusters rather than to place them randomly across the landscape.},

	abstract = {With current crises of academic relevance and legitimacy, there is a need for epistemic equity inherent to community-engaged research. Scholars in science communication and science and technology studies have analyzed, advocated for, and conducted public engagement in pursuit of this goal. However, despite desires to celebrate public engagement, US academic institutions and organizations often present barriers to meaningful community-engaged research. From tenure and promotion requirements, to lack of recognition and resources, universities in the American academic landscape are not currently organized to support such work. In this article, we offer a conceptual framework to examine the complex structural dimensions of academic institutions that have systematically discouraged and devalued faculty participation in community-engaged scholarship. We outline four such structural dimensions: interrogating epistemic biases, neoliberalist tendencies, gendered norms, and colonial-racist defaults. Our goal is to illuminate processes that could inform interventions to bridge the gap between academic aspirations for community-engaged work and current actions in the academy that undermine it.},

Formation of neckteeth is strongest in the second instar followed by the third instar, whereas only small neckteeth are found in the first and fourth instar of experimental clones. Predation experiments showed that body-size-dependent vulnerability of animals without neckteeth to fourth instar C. crystallinus larvae matched the pattern of neckteeth formation over the four juvenile instars. Predation experiments on D. pulex of the same clone with neckteeth showed that vulnerability to C. crystallinus predation is reduced, and that the induced protection is correlated with the degree of neckteeth formation. The pattern of neckteeth formation in successive instars is probably adaptive, and it can be concluded that neckteeth are formed to different degrees in successive instars as an evolutionary compromise to balance prediation risk and protective costs.},

The ephippial capsule prevents the completion of development but is not a barrier to an adequate light stimulus. Working with decapsulated eggs, the response to light increased to 100 \% within 9 days of storage in the dark and remained at 100\% for up to 60 days of storage in the dark. The response was not dependent on drying the ephippia. Ephippia stored in the light did not reach 100\% response to illumination when decapsulated, indicating that activation was dependent on prior dark reactions. About 4500 ft-c-min of fluorescent light energy was required for 100\% activation. The effective wavelengths were between 350 and 475 mµ with 2 x 106 ergs/cm2 sufficient to initiate nearly 100\% development at 410 mµ, the most effective wavelength. Low temperature interfered with photoactivation but not with subsequent development. Chilling the ephippia resulted in an increased light requirement. Kinetic studies with chilled ephippia stored for various times in the dark indicated a diphasic process of photoactivation which has tentatively been interpreted as a light-dependent release of inhibition.},

We found that the walls of ephippia in Daphniidae are composed of three interconnected layers of different structure. The external and internal layers, which are relatively solid, are covered by cell-like multiple polyhedron compartments formed by the middle layer. The three layers, which resemble a honeycomb structure, may offer mechanical protection for dormant eggs on one hand and may facilitate passive dispersal of ephippia containing diapausing eggs on the other. The cell-like compartments within the wall may be filled with air that makes them buoyant and may facilitate their passive dispersal within or between water bodies by animate or inanimate vectors operating on the water surface. We found significant structural differences between the ephippia of representatives from the subgenus Daphnia vs Ctenodaphnia. In the first group (in Daphnia pulex and Daphnia longispina) the middle layer is formed from empty cells readily filled with air even after brief contact with the atmosphere while in Ctenodaphnia such as Daphnia magna and Daphnia lumholtzi the middle layer of the ephippium cells are filled with filaments which hardly absorb atmospheric air. Structural differences between the two groups may reflect both their phylogenetic divergence and their various dispersal strategies.},

The genetic structure and dynamics of Daphnia populations are closely linked with the physical environment through its influence on the evolution and operation of the mating system and diapause strategy Only those clonal groups that frequently produce resting eggs can inhabit a temporary pond. Since successful ephippial production by a particular clonal group appears to occur only after that group has attained a very high density, an ephemeral environment will facilitate the selection of temporally specialized clonal groups. Ephippial production is much less frequent in permanent environments where the overwintering of females is an optional mechanism for the maintenance of clonal groups. Such conditions favor generalist genotypes (those that can survive all seasons), while selecting against highly specialized clones. The temporary pond population observed in this study exhibited a seasonal succession involving the same clonal groups for three consecutive years. These clonal groups often differed substantially in their life history parameters, suggesting that they have indeed specialized to different sets of environmental conditions. On the other hand, the permanent lake population was dominated throughout the year by two genetically distant but phenotypically similar composite genotypes. Additional observations on the genetic structure of this population are consistent with the hypothesis that, with little interruption by sexual reproduction, long-term selection removes all but a few generalist genotypes from a permanent environment.},

In particular, the integration of transcriptomics with physiological and ecological research is increasingly playing an important role in identifying functional physiological thresholds predictive of compensatory responses and detrimental outcomes, transforming the way we can study issues in conservation biology. Notably, with technological advances in RNA sequencing, transcriptome-wide approaches can now be applied to species where no prior genomic sequence information is available to develop species-specific tools and investigate sublethal impacts that can contribute to population declines over generations and undermine prospects for long-term conservation success. Here, we examine the use of transcriptomics as a means of determining organismal responses to environmental stressors and use key study examples of conservation concern in fishes to highlight the added value of transcriptome-wide data to the identification of functional response pathways. Finally, we discuss the gaps between the core science and policy frameworks and how thresholds identified through transcriptomic evaluations provide evidence that can be more readily used by resource managers.},

	abstract = {Recent developments in environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis allow more rapid and extensive biomonitoring than traditional capture-based surveys do. However, detection of eDNA not derived from living organisms may lead to false-positive inferences of species presence. Such limitations may be overcome by utilizing RNA molecules present in the environment (environmental RNA [eRNA]) because of their physiochemical instability. Nevertheless, the biomonitoring performance of eRNA analysis remains unclarified because of the substantial lack of knowledge regarding basic eRNA properties, such as its persistence and degradation mechanisms. Here, we performed a factorial aquarium experiment to assess the effects of water temperature (10, 20, and 30°C) and pH (4, 7, and 10) conditions on the degradation of zebrafish (Danio rerio) eDNA and eRNA, targeting the mitochondrial cytochrome b (CytB) and nuclear beta-2-microglobulin (b2m) genes. A linear mixed-model analysis showed that the degradation of eRNA was significantly faster than that of eDNA. Higher water temperatures promoted both eDNA and eRNA degradation, and alkaline conditions substantially promoted eRNA but not eDNA degradation. This might be explained by the physicochemical characteristics of DNA and RNA molecules, the membranous structure surrounding them, and their susceptibility to environmental microbial activity. Moreover, the relative concentrations of zebrafish eRNA to eDNA decreased over time, inferring that the ratio of eRNA to eDNA concentrations can be used for estimating the elapsed time since the genomic material was released and the freshness of the target eDNA signal in the field. Nevertheless, given that the confidence intervals of the eDNA and eRNA decay rates tended to overlap for each treatment level, this study indicates that fish eRNA is not always degraded rapidly and is, in fact, more abundant in water than previously expected. This result favors the application of eRNA analysis to indicate living biotic assemblages.},

	abstract = {How biological diversity is generated and maintained is a fundamental question in ecology. Ecologists have delineated many mechanisms that can, in principle, favor species coexistence and hence maintain biodiversity. Most such coexistence mechanisms require or imply tradeoffs between different aspects of species performance. However, it remains unknown whether simple functional tradeoffs underlie coexistence mechanisms in diverse natural systems. We show that functional tradeoffs explain species differences in long-term population dynamics that are associated with recovery from low density (and hence coexistence) for a community of winter annual plants in the Sonoran Desert. We develop a new general framework for quantifying the magnitude of coexistence via the storage effect and use this framework to assess the strength of the storage effect in the winter annual community. We then combine a 25-year record of vital rates with morphological and physiological measurements to identify functional differences between species in the growth and reproductive phase of the life cycle that promote storage-effect coexistence. Separation of species along a tradeoff between growth capacity and low-resource tolerance corresponds to differences in demographic responses to environmental variation across years. Growing season precipitation is one critical environmental variable underlying the demographic decoupling of species. These results demonstrate how partially decoupled population dynamics that promote local biodiversity are associated with physiological differences in resource uptake and allocation between species. These results for a relatively simple system demonstrate how long-term community dynamics relate to functional biology, a linkage scientists have long sought for more complex systems.},

Modern coexistence theory highlights two fluctuation-dependent temporal coexistence mechanisms —the storage effect and relative nonlinearity – but empirical tests are rare. Here, we experimentally test if environmental fluctuations enhance coexistence in a California annual grassland. We manipulate rainfall timing and relative densities of the grass Avena barbata and forb Erodium botrys, parameterise a demographic model, and partition coexistence mechanisms. Rainfall variability was integral to grass–forb coexistence. Variability enhanced growth rates of both species, and early-season drought was essential for Erodium persistence. While theoretical developments have focused on the storage effect, it was not critical for coexistence. In comparison, relative nonlinearity strongly stabilised coexistence, where Erodium experienced disproportionately high growth under early-season drought due to competitive release from Avena. Our results underscore the importance of environmental variability and suggest that relative nonlinearity is a critical if underappreciated coexistence mechanism.},

Unfortunately, the storage effect is poorly understood, in part because the generality of the storage effect precludes an interpretation that is simultaneously simple, intuitive and correct. Here, we explicate the storage effect by dividing one of its key conditions—covariance between environment and competition—into two pieces, namely that there must be a strong causal relationship between environment and competition, and that the effects of the environment do not change too quickly. This finer-grained definition can explain a number of previous results, including (1) that the storage effect promotes annual plant coexistence when the germination rate fluctuates, but not when the seed yield fluctuates, (2) that the storage effect is more likely to be induced by resource competition than the apparent competition, and (3) why the storage effect arises readily in models with either stage structure or environmental autocorrelation. Additionally, our expanded definition suggests two novel mechanisms by which the temporal storage effect can arise—transgenerational plasticity and causal chains of environmental variables—thus suggesting that the storage effect is a more common phenomenon than previously thought.},

To address this persistent barrier, we provide a general and accessible guide that covers the basic, step-by-step process of how to approach, understand, and use ecological theory in empirical work. We first give an overview of how and why mathematical theory is created, then outline four specific ways to use both mathematical and verbal theory to motivate empirical work, and finally present a practical tool kit for reading and understanding the mathematical aspects of ecological theory.

	abstract = {The focus of most ideas on diversity maintenance is species coexistence, which may be stable or unstable. Stable coexistence can be quantified by the long-term rates at which community members recover from low density. Quantification shows that coexistence mechanisms function in two major ways: They may be (a) equalizing because they tend to minimize average fitness differences between species, or (b) stabilizing because they tend to increase negative intraspecific interactions relative to negative interspecific interactions. Stabilizing mechanisms are essential for species coexistence and include traditional mechanisms such as resource partitioning and frequency-dependent predation, as well as mechanisms that depend on fluctuations in population densities and environmental factors in space and time. Equalizing mechanisms contribute to stable coexistence because they reduce large average fitness inequalities which might negate the effects of stabilizing mechanisms. Models of unstable coexitence, in which species diversity slowly decays over time, have focused almost exclusively on equalizing mechanisms. These models would be more robust if they also included stabilizing mechanisms, which arise in many and varied ways but need not be adequate for full stability of a system. Models of unstable coexistence invite a broader view of diversity maintenance incorporating species turnover.},

	abstract = {A general model of competitive and apparent competitive interactions in a spatially-variable environment is developed and analyzed to extend findings on coexistence in a temporally-variable environment to the spatial case and to elucidate new principles. In particular, coexistence mechanisms are divided into variation-dependent and variation-independent mechanisms with variation-dependent mechanisms including spatial generalizations of relative nonlinearity and the storage effect. Although directly analogous to the corresponding temporal mechanisms, these spatial mechanisms involve different life history traits which suggest that the spatial storage effect should arise more commonly than the temporal storage effect and spatial relative nonlinearity should arise less commonly than temporal relative nonlinearity. Additional mechanisms occur in the spatial case due to spatial covariance between the finite rate of increase of a local population and its local abundance, which has no clear temporal analogue. A limited analysis of these additional mechanisms shows that they have similar properties to the storage effect and relative nonlinearity and potentially may be considered as enlargements of the earlier mechanisms. The rate of increase of a species perturbed to low density is used to quantify coexistence. A general quadratic approximation, which is exact in some important cases, divides this rate of increase into contributions from the various mechanisms above and admits no other mechanisms, suggesting that opportunities for coexistence in a spatially-variable environment are fully characterized by these mechanisms within this general model. Three spatially-implicit models are analyzed as illustrations of the general findings and of techniques using small variance approximations. The contributions to coexistence of the various mechanisms are expressed in terms of simple interpretable formulae. These spatially-implicit models include a model of an annual plant community, a spatial multispecies version of the lottery model, and a multispecies model of an insect community competing for spatially-patchy and ephemeral food.},

Progress requires determining which processes and species differences are most important for coexistence when multiple processes operate and species differ in many ways. Modern coexistence theory (MCT), formalised by Chesson, holds out the promise of doing that, but empirical applications remain scarce. We argue that MCT's mathematical complexity and subtlety have obscured the simplicity and power of its underlying ideas and hindered applications. We present a general computational approach that extends our previous solution for the storage effect to all of standard MCT's spatial and temporal coexistence mechanisms, and also process-defined mechanisms amenable to direct study such as resource partitioning, indirect competition, and life history trade-offs. The main components are a method to partition population growth rates into contributions from different mechanisms and their interactions, and numerical calculations in which some mechanisms are removed and others retained. We illustrate how our approach handles features that have not been analysed in the standard framework through several case studies: competing diatom species under fluctuating temperature, plant–soil feedbacks in grasslands, facilitation in a beach grass community, and niche differences with independent effects on recruitment, survival and growth in sagebrush steppe.},

We perturbed an empirical sagebrush steppe community model to remove the demographic effect of niche differences and quantify their impact on coexistence. With stabilizing mechanisms operating, all species showed positive growth rates when rare, generating stable coexistence. Fluctuation-independent mechanisms contributed more than temporal variability to coexistence and operated more strongly on recruitment than growth or survival. As expected, removal of stabilizing niche differences led to extinction of all inferior competitors. However, complete exclusion required 300–400 years, indicating small fitness differences among species. Our results show an ‘excess’ of niche differences: stabilizing mechanisms were not only strong enough to maintain diversity but were much stronger than necessary given the small fitness differences. The diversity of this community cannot be understood without consideration of niche differences.},

In natural beds, several small beds had significantly more species than a single large bed. This occurred because a large proportion of species were not shared among beds. However, results of experiments using artificial seagrass beds to manipulate size of beds were equivocal. More species and more individuals were found in several small beds on only few occasions in experimental treatments. These results contradicted the patterns found in comparisons among natural beds.

Evidence suggests that community assembly often leads to a single stable equilibrium, such that the conditions of the environment and interspecific interactions determine which species will exist there. In such cases, regions of local communities with similar environmental conditions should have similar community composition. Other evidence suggests that community assembly can lead to multiple stable equilibria. Thus, the resulting community depends on the assembly history, even when all species have access to the community. In these cases, a region of local communities with similar environmental conditions can be very dissimilar in their community composition. Both regional and local factors should determine the patterns by which communities assemble, and the resultant degree of similarity or dissimilarity among localities with similar environments. A single equilibrium in more likely to be realized in systems with small regional species pools, high rates of connectance, low productivity and high disturbance. Multiple stable equilibria are more likely in systems with large regional species pools, low rates of connectance, high productivity and low disturbance. I illustrate preliminary evidence for these predictions from an observational study of small pond communities, and show important effects on community similarity, as well as on local and regional species richness.},

One famous hypothesis of diversity maintenance under disturbance is the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH). The IDH proposes patterns of peaked diversity under intermediate disturbance regimes, based on a tension between competitively superior species and species which can rapidly colonize following disturbance. We review the literature, and describe recent research that suggests that more than one underlying mechanism can generate this unimodal diversity pattern in disturbed environments. Several exciting emerging research areas are identified, including interactions between disturbance types, operation of the IDH in multi-trophic systems, and changes in disturbance regimes. However, empirical work is still focussed on describing the IDH pattern, with little emphasis on identifying its mechanistic basis. We discuss how to extend methods for identifying different coexistence mechanisms, developed in the theoretical literature, to experimental research. In an attempt to operationalize these various ideas we outline a hypothetical IDH research programme. A solid understanding of the life history attributes of the component species and their responses to disturbance will facilitate identification of the coexistence mechanism(s) underlying the IDH pattern, and provide a framework by which empirical and theoretical results can be more fully integrated.},

One of these categories includes classical mechanisms that do not depend on fluctuations over time. Another category includes mechanisms which may be referred to collectively as the storage effect. These mechanisms involve species-specific responses to environmental fluctuations, a relationship between fluctuations in competition and fluctuations in the environment, and an interaction between environment and competition. The final category depends on fluctuating competition and nonlinear responses to competition that differ between species.

	abstract = {A quantitative approach to species coexistence based on the invasibility criterion has led to an appreciation of coexistence mechanisms in terms of stabilizing and equalizing components, but major challenges are the need to consider general multispecies settings, interactions beyond competition, and multiple scales of space and time. Moreover, two essential concepts, species-level average fitness and scaling factors, have not had clear definitions. A general approach to defining average fitnesses and scaling factors is given, along with the origin of stabilizing mechanisms as deviations from a reference model where no coexistence is possible. Illustrations are general Lotka–Volterra models, models accounting specifically for resource use and natural enemies, and models with temporal fluctuations. Community averages of stabilizing mechanisms reveal overall opportunities for coexistence, and define mechanisms more precisely through their formulae. Average fitnesses adjusted for the presence of coexistence mechanisms provide a better definition of equalizing mechanisms. While these ideas apply to the components of invasion rates, permanence theory and stochastic persistence theory show how invasion rates can be used to demonstrate species coexistence in complex settings. Although species coexistence has often focused on competition, detailed models of the roles of natural enemies provide a new perspective on the opportunities for coexistence in nature. The concept of apparent competition recognizes the essential symmetry between density-dependence from resource depletion and from supporting natural enemies. Natural enemy partitioning is the natural analogue of resource partitioning and has an equivalent role in promoting coexistence. Rather than reinforcing each other, however, the strength of coexistence is often intermediate between that implied by resource partitioning alone and that implied by natural enemy partitioning alone, as elucidated by recent Lotka–Volterra theory. Synthesis. Although there are alternative approaches for understanding coexistence in multispecies settings, ideas based on stabilizing and equalizing mechanisms continue to provide new insights. Multiple species and multiple trophic levels are naturally challenging, but the new theories of permanence and stochastic persistence support the critical role of invasion rates in species coexistence, and thus support the understanding to be derived by partitioning invasion rates into average fitness differences and stabilizing components.},

	abstract = {For most species, a changeable environment creates a situation in which recruitment varies considerably from one breeding season to the next. If adults survive well, an occasional favorable recruitment can sustain population numbers over long periods. In effect, the gains made in favorable periods are stored in the adult population. Storage is particularly important when the species is at low densities, because then the potential population growth rate is very high if a favorable period occurs. Our past work showed that the storage mechanism could lead to coexistence of two species in lottery competition for space, as long as generations overlapped and there was sufficient variation in recruitment (Chesson and Warner 1981). This was true even if one species had an average competitive advantage. The storage model also operates when more than two species are competing, when resources renew independently of population sizes, and when not all the resource is used. It also operates in simple Lotka-Volterra systems in which adults do not compete directly with juveniles. The field ecologist is faced with the more practical problem of determining whether the storage mechanism is operating in a particular system. Species with relatively long lives and high fecundities are most likely to enjoy the benefits of the storage effect. Environments that theoretically elicit these life history characteristics are relatively benign and permanent for established adults, but are such that births and/or juvenile survivorship vary widely. Trees and many marine organisms are examples of species with the proper life histories, and storage may be important in maintaining the high diversity of these communities. The storage mechanism is capable of independently maintaining species coexistence, and we provide some suggestions on how to distinguish qualitatively the operation of storage from alternative mechanisms. We expect, however, that storage will make some positive contribution toward species persistence in nearly all communities, and we give a method for estimating empirically how large that contribution is.},

	abstract = {DNA and RNA sequencing technologies have revolutionized biology and biomedical sciences, sequencing full genomes and transcriptomes at very high speeds and reasonably low costs. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) enables transcript identification and quantification, but once sequencing has concluded researchers can be easily overwhelmed with questions such as how to go from raw data to differential expression (DE), pathway analysis and interpretation. Several pipelines and procedures have been developed to this effect. Even though there is no unique way to perform RNA-Seq analysis, it usually follows these steps: 1) raw reads quality check, 2) alignment of reads to a reference genome, 3) aligned reads’ summarization according to an annotation file, 4) DE analysis and 5) gene set analysis and/or functional enrichment analysis. Each step requires researchers to make decisions, and the wide variety of options and resulting large volumes of data often lead to interpretation challenges. There also seems to be insufficient guidance on how best to obtain relevant information and derive actionable knowledge from transcription experiments. In this paper, we explain RNA-Seq steps in detail and outline differences and similarities of different popular options, as well as advantages and disadvantages. We also discuss non-coding RNA analysis, multi-omics, meta-transcriptomics and the use of artificial intelligence methods complementing the arsenal of tools available to researchers. Lastly, we perform a complete analysis from raw reads to DE and functional enrichment analysis, visually illustrating how results are not absolute truths and how algorithmic decisions can greatly impact results and interpretation.},

	abstract = {Metatranscriptomics (MTX) has become an increasingly practical way to profile the functional activity of microbial communities in situ. However, MTX remains underutilized due to experimental and computational limitations. The latter are complicated by non-independent changes in both RNA transcript levels and their underlying genomic DNA copies (as microbes simultaneously change their overall abundance in the population and regulate individual transcripts), genetic plasticity (as whole loci are frequently gained and lost in microbial lineages) and measurement compositionality and zero-inflation. Here, we present a systematic evaluation of and recommendations for differential expression (DE) analysis in MTX.We designed and assessed six statistical models for DE discovery in MTX that incorporate different combinations of DNA and RNA normalization and assumptions about the underlying changes of gene copies or species abundance within communities. We evaluated these models on multiple simulated and real multi-omic datasets. Models adjusting transcripts relative to their encoding gene copies as a covariate were significantly more accurate in identifying DE from MTX in both simulated and real datasets. Moreover, we show that when paired DNA measurements (metagenomic data) are not available, models normalizing MTX measurements within-species while also adjusting for total-species RNA balance sensitivity, specificity and interpretability of DE detection, as does filtering likely technical zeros. The efficiency and accuracy of these models pave the way for more effective MTX-based DE discovery in microbial communities.The analysis code and synthetic datasets used in this evaluation are available online at http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/mtx2021.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {The widespread emergence of human and wildlife diseases has challenged ecologists to understand how large-scale agents of environmental change affect host–pathogen interactions. Accelerated eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems owing to nitrogen and phosphorus enrichment is a pervasive form of environmental change that has been implicated in the emergence of diseases through direct and indirect pathways. We provide experimental evidence linking eutrophication and disease in a multihost parasite system. The trematode parasite Ribeiroia ondatrae sequentially infects birds, snails, and amphibian larvae, frequently causing severe limb deformities and mortality. Eutrophication has been implicated in the emergence of this parasite, but definitive evidence, as well as a mechanistic understanding, have been lacking until now. We show that the effects of eutrophication cascade through the parasite life cycle to promote algal production, the density of snail hosts, and, ultimately, the intensity of infection in amphibians. Infection also negatively affected the survival of developing amphibians. Mechanistically, eutrophication promoted amphibian disease through two distinctive pathways: by increasing the density of infected snail hosts and by enhancing per-snail production of infectious parasites. Given forecasted increases in global eutrophication, amphibian extinctions, and similarities between Ribeiroia and important human and wildlife pathogens, our results have broad epidemiological and ecological significance.},

We overcame this obstacle by co-opting behavioral plasticity in food choice among a group of animal consumers, allowing us to manipulate patterns of resource use while controlling for the effects of species identity and diversity. Within an aphid-parasitoid-radish community, we created a fully factorial manipulation of consumer resource-use breadth (specialist versus generalist) and species diversity (one versus three species) and found that resource exploitation improved with greater specialist, but not generalist, diversity. Therefore, resource partitioning, and not diversity per se, fostered greater overall resource consumption in our multispecies consumer communities.},

	abstract = {G. Evelyn Hutchinson more than a half century ago proposed that one could characterize the ecological niche of a species as an abstract mapping of population dynamics onto an environmental space, the axes of which are abiotic and biotic factors that influence birth and death rates. If a habitat has conditions within a species' niche, a population should persist without immigration from external sources, whereas if conditions are outside the niche, it faces extinction. Analyses of species' niches are essential to understanding controls on species' geographical range limits and how these limits might shift in our rapidly changing world. Recent developments in ecology and evolutionary biology suggest it is time to revisit and refine Hutchinson's niche concept. After reviewing techniques for quantifying niches, I examine subtleties that arise because of impacts species have on their own environments, the density-dependent modulation of how individuals experience environments, and the interplay of dispersal and temporal heterogeneity in determining population persistence. Moreover, the evolutionary record over all time scales reveals a spectrum of rates of change in species' niches, from rapid niche evolution to profound niche conservatism. Substantial challenges revolving around the evolutionary dimension of the Hutchinsonian niche include quantifying the magnitude of evolved intraspecific and clade-level variation in niches and understanding the factors that govern where along the spectrum of potential evolutionary rates any given lineage lies. A growing body of theory provides elements of a conceptual framework for understanding niche conservatism and evolution, paving the way for an evolutionary theory of the niche.},

Although a great deal of experimental work has been devoted to local causes of diversity, little is known about the effects of regional processes on local diversity and how they contribute to global diversity patterns in marine systems. We tested the effects of latitude and the richness of the regional species pool on the species richness of local epifaunal invertebrate communities by sampling the diversity of local sites in 12 independent biogeographic regions from 62°S to 63°N latitude. Both regional and local species richness displayed significant unimodal patterns with latitude, peaking at low latitudes and decreasing toward high latitudes. The latitudinal diversity gradient was represented at the scale of local sites because local species richness was positively and linearly related to regional species richness. The richness of the regional species pool explained 73-76\% of local species richness. On a global scale, the extent of regional influence on local species richness was nonrandom—the proportion of regional biota represented in local epifaunal communities increased significantly from low to high latitudes. The strong effect of the regional species pool implies that patterns of local diversity in temperate, tropical, and high-latitude marine benthic communities are influenced by processes operating on larger spatiotemporal scales than previously thought.},

	abstract = {The extent to which species richness in local communities is determined by regional and historical processes is not well understood. An increasingly popular way to investigate these large-scale processes is through regressions of local on regional species richness. We sampled local and regional species richness in a broad array of taxa from around the world to address five questions. First, is the relationship between local and regional species richness linear, or does local richness accumulate more slowly at progressively higher regional diversities, suggesting local saturation of species diversity? Second, do these relationships vary with locality size? Third, do taxa and continents differ in the form of relationships between local and regional diversity? Fourth, do relationships between local and regional diversity depart from that expected from a null model in which all individuals of a locality are randomly sampled from a regional pool of species whose abundances have a canonical log-normal distribution? Fifth, using this same null model, how does the expected relationship between local and regional species richness depend on the sampling intensity within localities? We used distribution maps to ensure that diversity was sampled in a consistent manner across diverse taxa. Each region was 500 × 500 km, and localities were 1\% and 10\% of the region size. There was no evidence of local species saturation, as local species richness was strongly and linearly related to regional richness at both spatial scales. Between scales, local diversity accumulated faster as a function of regional diversity at the larger spatial scale. The slope of this relationship between local and regional diversity was the same among taxa across continents, and between Australia and North America across taxa. In other words, at each spatial scale one relationship between local and regional diversity describes most cases very well. The null model showed that approximately linear relationships between local and regional diversity are expected when regional species abundances are log-normal and when the number of individuals sampled within localities is large (roughly 200 times the number of species in the most species-rich region examined). However, empirical slopes were less than expected from the null model, which we interpret as an effect of spatial turnover of species (beta diversity). Since these slopes were nevertheless similar among taxa and between regions, rates of spatial turnover must be approximately the same among these taxa and regions. The log-normal model also showed that nonlinear (concave down) relationships between local and regional diversity are expected under random sampling when sample size is small relative to regional diversity. Therefore, nonlinear relationships are not necessarily indicative of saturation. Our results suggest that at the scales investigated here local communities are unsaturated and that their diversities are strongly limited by species richness of the surrounding regions. Similarity between taxa and continents in the form of the local-regional diversity relationship implies that “rules” governing the assembly of local communities may be widely consistent. If so, understanding species diversity in local assemblages will require knowledge of processes acting at larger spatial scales, including determinants of regional species richness and spatial turnover of species.},

	abstract = {Recent developments in environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis allow more rapid and extensive biomonitoring than traditional capture-based surveys do. However, detection of eDNA not derived from living organisms may lead to false-positive inferences of species presence. Such limitations may be overcome by utilizing RNA molecules present in the environment (environmental RNA [eRNA]) because of their physiochemical instability. Nevertheless, the biomonitoring performance of eRNA analysis remains unclarified because of the substantial lack of knowledge regarding basic eRNA properties, such as its persistence and degradation mechanisms. Here, we performed a factorial aquarium experiment to assess the effects of water temperature (10, 20, and 30°C) and pH (4, 7, and 10) conditions on the degradation of zebrafish (Danio rerio) eDNA and eRNA, targeting the mitochondrial cytochrome b (CytB) and nuclear beta-2-microglobulin (b2m) genes. A linear mixed-model analysis showed that the degradation of eRNA was significantly faster than that of eDNA. Higher water temperatures promoted both eDNA and eRNA degradation, and alkaline conditions substantially promoted eRNA but not eDNA degradation. This might be explained by the physicochemical characteristics of DNA and RNA molecules, the membranous structure surrounding them, and their susceptibility to environmental microbial activity. Moreover, the relative concentrations of zebrafish eRNA to eDNA decreased over time, inferring that the ratio of eRNA to eDNA concentrations can be used for estimating the elapsed time since the genomic material was released and the freshness of the target eDNA signal in the field. Nevertheless, given that the confidence intervals of the eDNA and eRNA decay rates tended to overlap for each treatment level, this study indicates that fish eRNA is not always degraded rapidly and is, in fact, more abundant in water than previously expected. This result favors the application of eRNA analysis to indicate living biotic assemblages.},

	abstract = {1. Plots of local versus regional species richness are an exciting new tool for testing for species saturation in ecological communities. In this method, the local richness of a community is plotted as a function of its regional richness for different biogeographical regions. A proportional relationship between local and regional richness is interpreted as evidence for an unsaturated community, that is, a community with strong evolutionary limits to local richness. There will be no correlation between local and regional richness in a saturated community, that is, a community whose local species richness is limited largely by ecological processes. 2. Although at least 36 data sets have now been analysed using local–regional richness plots, there has not been much critical evaluation of the method. This paper provides such a critique, focusing on the selection of communities for comparison, the prevalence of pseudoreplication and multiple null models, and the effects of differing region size. 3. Local–regional richness plots are best suited for comparing similar habitats between different regions, not different habitats in a single region. In the latter, taxa effects and species pool effects are confounded. 4. Four very different types of local–regional richness plots have been published. Each type of plot has important underlying assumptions which are often not addressed by ecologists. 5. Of the 36 data sets reviewed in this paper, 13 were spatially pseudoreplicated, and 2 were temporally pseudoreplicated. Furthermore, ecologists differ in their choice of null model, with the result that the same local–regional plot could be interpreted as evidence for saturation by one ecologist, and for lack of saturation by another. 6. Differences in region size can result in pseudosaturation, the appearance of saturation by an unsaturated community. A simple model demonstrates this phenomenon. Other sources of error in estimating the regional species pool are also of concern. 7. In conclusion, local–regional richness plots are a potentially useful tool for distinguishing saturated from unsaturated communities, but should be used cautiously, and in conjunction with other supporting evidence (such as the presence or absence of competitive exclusion, resource limitation, density compensation and the effects of species invasions).},

During the past three decades, ecologists have sought to explain differences in local diversity by the influence of the physical environment on local interactions among species, interactions that are generally believed to limit the number of coexisting species. But diversity of the biological community often fails to converge under similar physical conditions, and local diversity bears a demonstrable dependence upon regional diversity. These observations suggest that regional and historical processes, as well as unique events and circumstances, profoundly influence local community structure. Ecologists must broaden their concepts of community processes and incorporate data from systematics, biogeography, and paleontology into analyses of ecological patterns and tests of community theory.},

	abstract = {What are the local community consequences of changes in regional species richness and composition? To answer this question we followed the assembly of microarthropod communities in defaunated areas of moss, embedded in a larger moss “region.” Regions were created by combining moss from spatially distinct sites, resulting in regional species pools that differed in both microarthropod richness and composition, but not area. Regional effects were less important than seasonality for local richness. Initial differences in regional richness had no direct effect on local species richness at any time along a successional gradient of 0.5–16 months. The structure of the regional pool affected both local richness and local composition, but these effects were seasonally dependent. Local species richness differed substantially between dates along the successional gradient and continued to increase 16 months after assembly began. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first critical test of saturation theory that experimentally manipulates regional richness. Further, our results failed to support the most important mechanisms proposed to explain the local richness–regional richness relationship. The results demonstrate that complicated interactions between assembly time, seasonality, and regional species pools contribute to structuring local species richness and composition in this community.},

Ecologists have attempted to distinguish between these two sets of processes using graphical evidence for local assemblage saturation. However, such efforts have been controversial and are antithetical to the fact that local diversity bears an imprint of both. We examine the local–regional species richness relationship from the perspective of the theory of island biogeography and develop a model that can produce the full range of observed local–regional richness relationships from linear to curvilinear. Importantly, unlike previous models, we do not require species interactions to produce the curvilinear pattern. Curvilinear relationships arise if per-species stochastic extinction rates are substantially higher than colonization rates, while linear relationships result if colonization rates are higher than extinction rates. Because we also show that merely changing the sampling scale can make local–regional relationships appear either saturated or unsaturated, an inference of ecological processes, derived solely from local–regional relationships, is unwarranted.},

Although the conditions of local and regional coexistence have been well defined in such systems, no study has attempted to provide clear predictions of classical community‐wide patterns. Here we provide predictions for species richness, species relative abundances, and community‐level functional properties (productivity and space occupation) at the local and regional scales as functions of the proportion of dispersal between communities. Local (α) diversity is maximal at an intermediate level of dispersal, whereas between‐community (β) and regional (γ) diversity decline as dispersal increases because of increased homogenization of the metacommunity. The relationships between local and regional species richness and the species rank abundance distributions are strongly affected by the level of dispersal. Local productivity and space occupation tend to decline as dispersal increases, resulting in either a hump‐shaped or a positive relationship between species richness and productivity, depending on the scale considered (local or regional). These effects of dispersal are buffered by decreasing species dispersal success. Our results provide a niche‐based alternative to the recent neutral‐metacommunity model and have important implications for conservation biology and landscape management.},

These have somewhat distinct intellectual histories and we discuss elements related to their potential future synthesis. We then use this framework to discuss why the concept is useful in modifying existing ecological thinking and illustrate this with a number of both theoretical and empirical examples. As ecologists strive to understand increasingly complex mechanisms and strive to work across multiple scales of spatio-temporal organization, concepts like the metacommunity can provide important insights that frequently contrast with those that would be obtained with more conventional approaches based on local communities alone.},

The local community is an epiphenomenon that has relatively little explanatory power in ecology and evolutionary biology. Local coexistence cannot provide insight into the ecogeographic distributions of species within a region, from which local assemblages of species derive, nor can local communities be used to test hypotheses concerning the origin, maintenance, and regulation of species richness, either locally or regionally.

Here we argue that empirical evidence supports a model whereby ecological factors associated with resource availability regulate species richness at continental scales. Any large-scale predictive model for biological diversity must explain three robust patterns in the natural world. First, species richness for evolutionary biotas is highly correlated with resource-associated surrogate variables, including area, temperature, and productivity. Second, species richness across epochal timescales is largely stationary in time. Third, the dynamics of diversity exhibit clear and predictable responses to mass extinctions, key innovations, and other perturbations. Collectively, these patterns are readily explained by a model in which species richness is regulated by diversity-dependent feedback mechanisms. We argue that many purported tests of the ecological limits hypothesis, including branching patterns in molecular phylogenies, are inherently weak and distract from these three core patterns. We have much to learn about the complex hierarchy of processes by which local ecological interactions lead to diversity dependence at the continental scale, but the empirical evidence overwhelmingly suggests that they do.},

In particular, early colonists can often arrive from a nearby community, adapt to local conditions, and subsequently alter the establishment or abundance of late-arriving species, often producing an evolutionary priority effect. We also discuss how interaction type and relative rates of colonization, evolution, and community interactions determine divergent community outcomes.

In the spatially expansive lowlands of both islands, communities converge in species richness and average morphology. But communities diverge in the highlands. On Jamaica, where limited highland area restricted diversification, communities remain depauperate and consist largely of elevational generalists. In contrast, a unique fauna of high-elevation specialists evolved in the vast Hispaniolan highlands, augmenting highland richness and driving islandwide turnover in community composition.

Current methods for comparing microbial communities face important limitations.

Methods These limitations motivated the development of a new de novo metagenomic comparative method, called Simka. This method computes a large collection of standard ecological distances by replacing species counts by k-mer counts. Simka scales-up today’s metagenomic projects thanks to a new parallel k-mer counting strategy on multiple datasets. Results Experiments on public Human Microbiome Project datasets demonstrate that Simka captures the essential underlying biological structure. Simka was able to compute in a few hours both qualitative and quantitative ecological distances on hundreds of metagenomic samples (690 samples, 32 billions of reads). We also demonstrate that analyzing metagenomes at the k-mer level is highly correlated with extremely precise de novo comparison techniques which rely on all-versus-all sequences alignment strategy or which are based on taxonomic profiling.},

	abstract = {Differential expression (DE) analysis of RNA-seq data still poses inferential challenges, such as handling of transcripts characterized by low expression levels. In this study, we use a plasmode-based approach to assess the relative performance of alternative inferential strategies on RNA-seq transcripts, with special emphasis on transcripts characterized by a small number of read counts, so-called low-count transcripts, as motivated by an ecological application in prairie grasses. Big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii) is a wide-ranging dominant prairie grass of ecological and agricultural importance to the US Midwest while edaphic subspecies sand bluestem (A. gerardii ssp. Hallii) grows exclusively on sand dunes. Relative to big bluestem, sand bluestem exhibits qualitative phenotypic divergence consistent with enhanced drought tolerance, plausibly associated with transcripts of low expression levels. Our dataset consists of RNA-seq read counts for 25,582 transcripts (60 \% of which are classified as low-count) collected from leaf tissue of individual plants of big bluestem (n = 4) and sand bluestem (n = 4). Focused on low-count transcripts, we compare alternative ad-hoc data filtering techniques commonly used in RNA-seq pipelines and assess the inferential performance of recently developed statistical methods for DE analysis, namely DESeq2 and edgeR robust. These methods attempt to overcome the inherently noisy behavior of low-count transcripts by either shrinkage or differential weighting of observations, respectively.},

	abstract = {To allow efficient transcript/gene detection, highly abundant ribosomal RNAs (rRNA) are generally removed from total RNA either by positive polyA+ selection or by rRNA depletion (negative selection) before sequencing. Comparisons between the two methods have been carried out by various groups, but the assessments have relied largely on non-clinical samples. In this study, we evaluated these two RNA sequencing approaches using human blood and colon tissue samples. Our analyses showed that rRNA depletion captured more unique transcriptome features, whereas polyA+ selection outperformed rRNA depletion with higher exonic coverage and better accuracy of gene quantification. For blood- and colon-derived RNAs, we found that 220\% and 50\% more reads, respectively, would have to be sequenced to achieve the same level of exonic coverage in the rRNA depletion method compared with the polyA+ selection method. Therefore, in most cases we strongly recommend polyA+ selection over rRNA depletion for gene quantification in clinical RNA sequencing. Our evaluation revealed that a small number of lncRNAs and small RNAs made up a large fraction of the reads in the rRNA depletion RNA sequencing data. Thus, we recommend that these RNAs are specifically depleted to improve the sequencing depth of the remaining RNAs.},

Species-specific primers and a minor groove binding probe were designed for the assay, based on the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene. The results of this study indicate that environmental DNA is a highly effective tool for detecting S. salar in situ, and could provide an alternative, non-invasive method for determining the distribution of this species.},

Quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) techniques have evolved to become commonplace, however, data analysis includes many time-consuming and cumbersome steps, which can lead to mistakes and misinterpretation of data. To address these bottlenecks, we have developed an open-source Python software to automate processing of result spreadsheets from qPCR machines, employing calculations usually performed manually. Auto-qPCR is a tool that saves time when computing qPCR data, helping to ensure reproducibility of qPCR experiment analyses. Our web-based app (https://auto-q-pcr.com/) is easy to use and does not require programming knowledge or software installation. Using Auto-qPCR, we provide examples of data treatment, display and statistical analyses for four different data processing modes within one program: (1) DNA quantification to identify genomic deletion or duplication events; (2) assessment of gene expression levels using an absolute model, and relative quantification (3) with or (4) without a reference sample. Our open access Auto-qPCR software saves the time of manual data analysis and provides a more systematic workflow, minimizing the risk of errors. Our program constitutes a new tool that can be incorporated into bioinformatic and molecular biology pipelines in clinical and research labs.},

They also reported gaining new techniques (56\%), skills (64\%), and novel ideas (70\%) to further their research/careers. Nearly all (91\%) gained new contacts that improved their research, in-the-field conservation, science communication, and/or conservation policy making. Two thirds (64\%) gained ideas, contacts, and/or lessons could lead to publications. Over a third (39\%) gained new ideas, contacts and/or lessons that led to grant proposals, and 36\% gained contacts that led to funding.

A regression analysis revealed that both greater degree of perceived parental control and lower levels of self-esteem emerged as significant predictors of impostor fears, together accounting for 50\% of the variation in impostor scores. Parental care score, parental educational and occupational level and subject's mental health and demographic information did not show a significant relationship to impostor scores. A post-hoc regression analysis indicated, however, that in addition to parental protection, lower care and poorer mental health was significantly related to increasing levels of impostor scores and with subjects having attended private school reporting lower levels of impostor feelings. In addition, subjects classified as impostors were found to report significantly higher GHQ scores (poorer mental health) than non-impostors. These findings, which are interpreted in terms of parenting styles, indicate that the role of parental overprotection may be especially implicated in impostor fears.},

Imposter syndrome is a psychological term that refers to a pattern of behavior wherein people (even those with adequate external evidence of success) doubt their abilities and have a persistent fear of being exposed as a fraud. Online, there were numerous responses: women talked frankly about how they attributed accomplishments to luck or good timing instead of merit, voicing fears that they had simply duped others with an illusion of competence.The sheer prevalence was emphasized by an aspiring surgeon: “I’d like to meet someone who HASN’T experienced imposter syndrome.” Others highlighted how the syndrome disproportionately affects women and minority groups—who often lack sufficient role models of success. Many reported that it led to meaningful setbacks in their careers, from being too paralyzed to speak up at meetings to not asking for opportunities or promotions due to feeling unqualified. An academic hospitalist wrote, “There are invisible gates or wormholes to better career possibilities. Having imposter syndrome means you will miss the gate when someone asks you if you’re ready or interested in something.”},

	abstract = {Black students face repeated racial microaggressions that may challenge their mental health and academic performance in engineering doctoral programs. Researchers attribute this to stereotypes and institutional climates that juxtapose their STEM and racial identities as incongruent. In this article, we analyzed the perceptions of environmental, behavioral, and verbal racial microaggressions of 33 Black doctoral students and postdocs, with a focus on their interactions with non-Black peers. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with Black doctoral students from 11 Predominantly White Institutions in the United States. To analyze the experiences of our participants, we utilized two theoretical frameworks: Racial microaggressions and identity nonverification. Across the interviews, participants described various forms of racial microaggressions that greatly challenged their sense of belonging and identities as engineers. This research affirms the need to develop initiatives at the departmental and institutional levels to encourage more inclusive spaces for diverse students in STEM doctoral programs and to combat the types of exclusionary practices found in this study.},

Environmental DNA (eDNA)-based biomonitoring provides robust, efficient, and cost-effective assessment of species occurrences and population trends in diverse aquatic environments. Thus, it holds great potential for improving conventional surveillance frameworks to facilitate fish conservation and fisheries management. However, the many technical considerations and rapid developments underway in the eDNA arena can overwhelm researchers and practitioners new to the field. Here, we systematically analysed 416 fish eDNA studies to summarize research trends in terms of investigated targets, research aims, and study systems, and reviewed the applications, rationales, methodological considerations, and limitations of eDNA methods with an emphasis on fish and fisheries research. We highlighted how eDNA technology may advance our knowledge of fish behaviour, species distributions, population genetics, community structures, and ecological interactions. We also synthesized the current knowledge of several important methodological concerns, including the qualitative and quantitative power eDNA has to recover fish biodiversity and abundance, and the spatial and temporal representations of eDNA with respect to its sources. To facilitate ecological applications implementing fish eDNA techniques, recent literature was summarized to generate guidelines for effective sampling in lentic, lotic, and marine habitats. Finally, we identified current gaps and limitations, and pointed out newly emerging research avenues for fish eDNA. As methodological optimization and standardization improve, eDNA technology should revolutionize fish monitoring and promote biodiversity conservation and fisheries management that transcends geographic and temporal boundaries.},

	abstract = {Exhaustive biodiversity data, covering all the taxa in an environment, would be fundamental to understand how global changes influence organisms living at different trophic levels, and to evaluate impacts on interspecific interactions. Molecular approaches such as DNA metabarcoding are boosting our ability to perform biodiversity inventories. Nevertheless, even though a few studies have recently attempted exhaustive reconstructions of communities, holistic assessments remain rare. The majority of metabarcoding studies published in the last years used just one or two markers and analysed a limited number of taxonomic groups. Here, we provide an overview of emerging approaches that can allow all-taxa biological inventories. Exhaustive biodiversity assessments can be attempted by combining a large number of specific primers, by exploiting the power of universal primers, or by combining specific and universal primers to obtain good information on key taxa while limiting the overlooked biodiversity. Multiplexes of primers, shotgun sequencing and capture enrichment may provide a better coverage of biodiversity compared to standard metabarcoding, but still require major methodological advances. Here, we identify the strengths and limitations of different approaches, and suggest new development lines that might improve broad scale biodiversity analyses in the near future. More holistic reconstructions of ecological communities can greatly increase the value of metabarcoding studies, improving understanding of the consequences of ongoing environmental changes on the multiple components of biodiversity.},

Here, we move beyond the all-too-common narrative about integrating or incorporating (too often used as euphemisms for assimilating) other knowledge systems into Western science, instead of building an ethic of knowledge coexistence and complementarity in knowledge generation using Two-Eyed Seeing as a guiding framework. Two-Eyed Seeing (Etuaptmumk in Mi’kmaw) embraces “learning to see from one eye with the strengths of Indigenous knowledges and ways of knowing, and from the other eye with the strengths of mainstream knowledges and ways of knowing, and to use both these eyes together, for the benefit of all,” as envisaged by Elder Dr. Albert Marshall. In this paper, we examine the notion of knowledge dichotomies and imperatives for knowledge coexistence and draw parallels between Two-Eyed Seeing and other analogous Indigenous frameworks from around the world. It is set apart from other Indigenous frameworks in its explicit action imperative—central to Two-Eyed Seeing is the notion that knowledge transforms the holder and that the holder bears a responsibility to act on that knowledge. We explore its operationalization through three Canadian aquatic and fisheries case-studies that co-develop questions, document and mobilize knowledge, and co-produce insights and decisions. We argue that Two-Eyed Seeing provides a pathway to a plural coexistence, where time-tested Indigenous knowledge systems can be paired with, not subsumed by, Western scientific insights for an equitable and sustainable future.},

	abstract = {RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is popular for measuring gene expression in non-model organisms, including wild populations. While RNA-Seq can detect gene expression variation among wild-caught individuals and yield important insights into biological function, sampling methods can also affect gene expression estimates. We examined the influence of multiple technical variables on estimated gene expression in a non-model fish, the westslope cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi), using two RNA-Seq library types: 3′ RNA-Seq (QuantSeq) and whole mRNA-Seq (NEB). We evaluated effects of dip netting versus electrofishing, and of harvesting tissue immediately versus 5 min after euthanasia on estimated gene expression in blood, gill, and muscle. We found no significant differences in gene expression between sampling methods or tissue collection times with either library type. When library types were compared using the same blood samples, 58\% of genes detected by both NEB and QuantSeq showed significantly different expression between library types, and NEB detected 31\% more genes than QuantSeq. Although the two library types recovered different numbers of genes and expression levels, results with NEB and QuantSeq were consistent in that neither library type showed differences in gene expression between sampling methods and tissue harvesting times. Our study suggests that researchers can safely rely on different fish sampling strategies in the field. In addition, while QuantSeq is more cost effective, NEB detects more expressed genes. Therefore, when it is crucial to detect as many genes as possible (especially low expressed genes), when alternative splicing is of interest, or when working with an organism lacking good genomic resources, whole mRNA-Seq is more powerful.},

	abstract = {Migrations allow animals to track seasonal changes in resources, find mates, and avoid harsh climates, but these regular, long-distance movements also have implications for parasite dynamics and animal health. Migratory animals have been dubbed “superspreaders” of infection, but migration can also reduce parasite burdens within host populations via migratory escape from contaminated habitats and transmission hotspots, migratory recovery due to parasite mortality, and migratory culling of infected individuals. Here, we show that a single migratory host–macroparasite model can give rise to these different phenomena under different parametrizations, providing a unifying framework for a mechanistic understanding of the parasite dynamics of migratory animals. Importantly, our model includes the impact of parasite burden on host movement capability during migration, which can lead to “parasite-induced migratory stalling” due to a positive feedback between increasing parasite burdens and reduced movement. Our results provide general insight into the conditions leading to different health outcomes in migratory wildlife. Our approach lays the foundation for tactical models that can help understand, predict, and mitigate future changes of disease risk in migratory wildlife that may arise from shifting migratory patterns, loss of migratory behavior, or climate effects on parasite development, mortality, and transmission.},

Our results demonstrate a clear relationship between habitat diversity and species interaction strengths, with more diverse foraging landscapes containing higher production of prey and a greater proportion of weak and potentially stabilizing interactions. Additionally, rare patches of large and relatively stable river sediments intensified these effects and further reduced interaction strengths by increasing prey diversity. Our findings highlight the importance of landscape characteristics in promoting stabilizing food-web architectures and provide direct relevance for future management of imperilled species in a simplified and rapidly changing world.},

However, combined empirical study of biodiversity and multi-trophic food webs at a large spatial and temporal resolution has been prohibited by the lack of appropriate access to such data from natural systems. Here, we assessed biodiversity and food-web characteristics across a 700 km2 riverine network over seasons using environmental DNA. We found contrasting biodiversity patterns between major taxonomic groups. Local richness showed statistically significant, season-dependent increases and decreases towards downstream location within the catchment for fish and bacteria, respectively. Meanwhile, invertebrate richness remained spatially unchanged but varied across seasons. The structure of local food webs, such as link density and nestedness, also varied across space and time. However, these patterns did not necessarily mirror those observed for biodiversity and functional feeding characteristics. Our results suggest that biodiversity patterns and food-web dynamics are not directly scalable to each other even at the same spatial and temporal scales. In order to conserve species diversity as well as the functional trophic integrity of communities, patterns of biodiversity and food-web characteristics must thus be jointly studied.},

Uncovering the network architecture of such trophic interactions has been recognized as the essential step for exploring species with great impacts on ecosystem-level phenomena and functions. However, it has remained a major challenge to reveal how species-rich networks of predator–prey interactions are continually reshaped through time in the wild. Here, we show that dynamics of species-rich predator–prey interactions can be characterized by remarkable network structural changes and alternations of species with greatest impacts on community processes. On the basis of high-throughput detection of prey DNA from 1,556 spider individuals collected in a grassland ecosystem, we reconstructed dynamics of interaction networks involving, in total, 50 spider species and 974 prey species and strains through 8 months. The networks were compartmentalized into modules (groups) of closely interacting predators and prey in each month. Those modules differed in detritus/grazing food chain properties, forming complex fission–fusion dynamics of belowground and aboveground energy channels across the seasons. The substantial shifts of network structure entailed alternations of spider species located at the core positions within the entangled webs of interactions. These results indicate that knowledge of dynamically shifting food webs is crucial for understanding temporally varying roles of ‘core species’ in ecosystem processes.},

Our understanding of the interactive effects of climate warming and other environmental factors on the temporal changes of body size structure is limited. We quantified the annual trends in size spectra of 583 stream fish communities sampled for more than 20 years across France. The results show that climate warming steepened the slope of the community size spectrum in streams with limited impacts from other human pressures. These changes were caused by increasing abundance of small‐bodied individuals and decreasing abundance of large‐bodied individuals. However, opposite effects of climate warming on the size spectrum slopes were observed in streams facing high levels of other human pressures. This demonstrates that the effects of temperature on body size structure can depend on other human pressures, disrupting the natural patterns of size spectra in wild communities with potentially strong implications for the fluxes of energy and nutrients in ecosystems.},

	abstract = {The current advances of environmental DNA (eDNA) bring profound changes to ecological monitoring and provide unique insights on the biological diversity of ecosystems. The very nature of eDNA data is challenging yet also revolutionizing how biological monitoring information is analysed. In particular, new metrics and approaches should take full advantage of the extent and detail of molecular data produced by genetic methods. In this perspective, machine learning algorithms are particularly promising as they can capture complex relationships between the multiple environmental pressures and the diversity of biological communities. We investigated the potential of a new generation of biomonitoring tools that implement machine-learning techniques to fully exploit eDNA datasets. We trained a machine learning model to discriminate between reference and impacted communities of freshwater macroinvertebrates and assessed its performances using a large eDNA dataset collected at 64 standard federal monitoring sites across Switzerland. We show that a model trained on eDNA is significantly better than a naive model and performs similarly to a model trained on traditional data. Our proof-of-concept shows that such a combination of eDNA and machine learning approaches has the potential to complement or even replace traditional environmental monitoring, and could be scaled along temporal or spatial dimensions.},

	abstract = {1. Meta-analysis is a powerful and informative tool for basic and applied research. It provides a statistical framework for synthesizing and comparing the results of studies which have all tested a particular hypothesis. Meta-analysis has the potential to be particularly useful for ecologists and evolutionary biologists, as individual experiments often rely on small sample sizes due to the constraints of time and manpower, and therefore have low statistical power. 2. The rewards of conducting a meta-analysis can be significant. It can be the basis of a systematic review of a topic that provides a powerful exploration of key hypotheses or theoretical assumptions, thereby influencing the future development of a field of research. Alternatively, for the applied scientist, it can provide robust answers to questions of ecological, medical or economic significance. However, planning and conducting a meta-analysis can be a daunting prospect and the analysis itself is invariably demanding and labour intensive. Errors or omissions made at the planning stage can create weeks of extra work. 3. While a range of useful resources is available to help the budding meta-analyst on his or her way, much of the key information and explanation is spread across different articles and textbooks. In order to help the reader use the available information as efficiently as possible (and so avoid making time-consuming errors) this article aims to provide a ‘road map’ to the existing literature. It provides a brief guide to planning, organizing and implementing a meta-analysis which focuses more on logic and implementation than on maths; it is intended to be a first port of call for those interested in the topic and should be used in conjunction with the more detailed books and articles referenced. In the main, references are cited and discussed with an emphasis on useful reading order rather than a chronological history of meta-analysis and its uses. 4. No prior knowledge of meta-analysis is assumed in the current article, though it is assumed that the reader is familiar with anova and regression-type statistical models.},

	abstract = {Coral reefs are under threat from disease as climate change alters environmental conditions. Rising temperatures exacerbate coral disease, but this relationship is likely complex as other factors also influence coral disease prevalence. To better understand this relationship, we meta-analytically examined 108 studies for changes in global coral disease over time alongside temperature, expressed using average summer sea surface temperature (SST) and cumulative heat stress as weekly sea surface temperature anomalies (WSSTAs). We found that both rising average summer SST and WSSTA were associated with global increases in the mean and variability in coral disease prevalence. Global coral disease prevalence tripled, reaching 9.92\% in the 25 years examined, and the effect of ‘year’ became more stable (i.e. prevalence has lower variance over time), contrasting the effects of the two temperature stressors. Regional patterns diverged over time and differed in response to average summer SST. Our model predicted that, under the same trajectory, 76.8\% of corals would be diseased globally by 2100, even assuming moderate average summer SST and WSSTA. These results highlight the need for urgent action to mitigate coral disease. Mitigating the impact of rising ocean temperatures on coral disease is a complex challenge requiring global discussion and further study.},

	abstract = {Clear-cut logging of 41\% of the basin of Carnation Creek, British Columbia, resulted in increased stream temperatures in all months of the year, increases above prelogging temperatures ranged from 0.7 °C in December to 3.2 °C in August. Earlier emergence of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) fry associated with the temperature increases lengthened their summer growing season by up to 6 wk. Fingerlings were significantly larger by the fall in the years after logging compared with the years before logging. The increased size of fingerlings was associated with improved overwinter survival. Following logging, yearling smolt numbers doubled, although 2-yr-old smolt numbers decreased. Warmer spring temperatures were also associated with earlier seaward migration of smolts, probably resulting in decreased smolt-to-aduit survivals. A linked series of models that first predict logging effects on stream temperatures and then the effects of those temperatures on critical coho life history events are developed. The life history model is used to quantify the effects of stream temperature changes related to logging on the population size of adult coho salmon. The predicted effect of those temperature changes was a 9\% increase in adult coho numbers prior to the fishery, an increase considerably less than the observed 47\% increase in smolt numbers.},

Among individual watersheds, rates of decline in adult coho salmon abundance were correlated with agricultural land use, road density, and a qualitative measure of stream habitat status but not with the proportion of land recently logged.

Intertidal habitats offer a unique opportunity in this regard, as they are species rich ecosystems that exhibit rapid community turnover and pronounced responses to ecological disturbances. In an attempt to use these dynamic communities to identify the impact storage of harvested logs is having on the Kitimat River estuary, surveys evaluating the biotic and abiotic conditions within surrounding mudflats were conducted. The intertidal mudflats of the Kitimat River Estuary varied spatially and temporally, and with differences in the infaunal community, as well as the abiotic sediment conditions between reference mudflats, and mudflats potentially impacted by logging activities. While these differences were pronounced, we cannot at this time link these differences to the logging activities at impacted sites. We also observed evidence that suggests that the infaunal community of these intertidal mudflats have changed substantially since the 1970s, with the establishment of a community of polychaetes, as well as the appearance of the invasive clam Mya arenaria, and the invasive Cumacea Nippoleucon hinumensis. Beyond contrasting impacted and reference mudflats, the current health of these mudflats, as indicated by the infaunal community assemblage, is currently unclear. More research is required to determine if organic enrichment has occurred at these habitats, as well as to further elucidate the current health of these intertidal mudflats.},

Forestry activities can alter water temperatures and the delivery and storage of water, nutrients, wood, and sediment in streams, resulting in changes to the habitat, growth, and survival of juvenile salmon. Previous research on forestry impacts on habitat has focused on small, intensively monitored coastal systems. Here, we examined forestry activities, watershed characteristics, physical habitat, and stream temperature for 28 mid-sized tributaries of the North Thompson River to examine relationships between forestry and juvenile coho stream habitat in interior watersheds. Forest harvest had a positive correlation to maximum summer stream temperature. Streams with 35\% of the riparian area harvested since 1970 had maximum summer temperatures 3.7 °C higher on average than those with 5\% harvested. Stream gradient explained most of the variation in physical habitat and had negative correlations to pool cover, pool depth, and fine sediment cover. Taken together, these results indicate that watershed characteristics drive physical habitat, but forest harvest can be a primary driver of water temperatures.},

	abstract = {Marine and freshwater ecosystems are increasingly at risk of large and cascading changes from multiple human activities (termed “regime shifts”), which can impact population productivity, resilience, and ecosystem structure. Pacific salmon exhibit persistent and large fluctuations in their population dynamics driven by combinations of intrinsic (e.g., density dependence) and extrinsic factors (e.g., ecosystem changes, species interactions). In recent years, many Pacific salmon have declined due to regime shifts but clear understanding of the processes driving these changes remains elusive. Here, we unpacked the role of density dependence, ecosystem trends, and stochasticity on productivity regimes for a community of five anadromous Pacific salmonids (Steelhead, Coho Salmon, Pink Salmon, Dolly Varden, and Coastal Cutthroat Trout) across a rich 40-year time-series. We used a Bayesian multivariate state-space model to examine whether productivity shifts had similarly occurred across the community and explored marine or freshwater changes associated with those shifts. Overall, we identified three productivity regimes: an early regime (1976–1990), a compensatory regime (1991–2009), and a declining regime (since 2010) where large declines were observed for Steelhead, Dolly Varden, and Cutthroat Trout, intermediate declines in Coho and no change in Pink Salmon. These regime changes were associated with multiple cumulative effects across the salmon life cycle. For example, increased seal densities and ocean competition were associated with lower adult marine survival in Steelhead. Watershed logging also intensified over the past 40 years and was associated with (all else equal) ≥97\% declines in freshwater productivity for Steelhead, Cutthroat, and Coho. For Steelhead, marine and freshwater dynamics played approximately equal roles in explaining trends in total productivity. Collectively, these changing environments limited juvenile production and lowered future adult returns. These results reveal how changes in freshwater and marine environments can jointly shape population dynamics among ecological communities, like Pacific salmon, with cascading consequences to their resilience.},

	abstract = {Undergraduate research is widely perceived as a “high-impact practice” that promotes students’ learning, cognition, career planning, and educational attainment. With some exceptions, the existing evidence largely provides support for these beliefs. However, these studies typically examine research experiences that occur later in the undergraduate years, whereas engaging in undergraduate research during the first year is becoming increasingly common. First-year experiences may yield different outcomes than later experiences for a variety of reasons; in addition, previous studies often do not account sufficiently for self-selection into undergraduate research, which may be especially problematic for cross-sectional studies that occur in the junior or senior year. Therefore, this study examines the potential impact of first-year undergraduate research using propensity score analyses within a large, multi-institutional, longitudinal dataset. Research participation is significantly and positively related to first-year university satisfaction and fourth-year undergraduate GPA, but it is unrelated to satisfaction and grades in other years as well as graduate degree intentions, retention at the same institution, and 4-year graduation. Conditional analyses indicate that these effects are largely consistent across student demographics, pre-university achievement, and institutional selectivity.},

In contrast, little is known about the short-term academic consequences of borrowing to finance college attendance. We use detailed student-level administrative data to examine the relationship between the type and amount of student loans used to pay for college and students' academic performance, choice of major, and retention rates. The results suggest that students who take out loans have lower grade point averages (GPAs) than students who do not. Among students with debt, those with greater student loan balances have lower GPAs, take fewer credits per semester, and have lower retention rates. This is true conditioning on detailed background characteristics as well as in individual fixed effect specifications that control for unobserved time-constant characteristics of students. These results can help inform policies to mitigate the adverse effects of increasing education debt.},

First, we sought to clarify how two distinct aspects of perceived family support—social support and economic support—affect college students’ academic performance. Second, we sought to determine how these two aspects of family support influence not only cumulative GPA scores but also the overall trend (slope) and stability (variability) of students’ GPA scores across semesters. The participants in this longitudinal study were 240 university students (62 men, 178 women). The results revealed that the level of perceived family social support was important not only as a “main effect” predictor of the magnitude and stability of the students’ GPA scores across three successive semesters, but also as a factor that helped female students to succeed regardless of their level of family economic support. In general, the data suggest that family social support is more important to women’s success in college than to men’s.},

We synthesise these steps into four actionable ideas: anti-racism education and practice, increased funding opportunities, integration of diverse cultural perspectives and a community-minded shift in PhDs. Importantly, this advice is specifically directed at those who wield power in the Academy (e.g. funding agencies, societies, institutions, departments and faculty), rather than BIPOC scholars already struggling against inequitable frameworks in EEB.},

Many academic EECB departments seek concrete ways to improve the climate and implement anti-racist policies in their teaching, training and research activities. We present a toolkit of evidence-based interventions for academic EECB departments to foster anti-racism in three areas: in the classroom; within research laboratories; and department wide. To spark restorative discussion and action in these areas, we summarize EECB’s racist and ethnocentric histories, as well as current systemic problems that marginalize non-white groups. Finally, we present ways that EECB departments can collectively address shortcomings in equity and inclusion by implementing anti-racism, and provide a positive model for other departments and disciplines.},

	abstract = {Prior work finds a diversity paradox: Diversity breeds innovation, yet underrepresented groups that diversify organizations have less successful careers within them. Does the diversity paradox hold for scientists as well? We study this by utilizing a near-complete population of ∼1.2 million US doctoral recipients from 1977 to 2015 and following their careers into publishing and faculty positions. We use text analysis and machine learning to answer a series of questions: How do we detect scientific innovations? Are underrepresented groups more likely to generate scientific innovations? And are the innovations of underrepresented groups adopted and rewarded? Our analyses show that underrepresented groups produce higher rates of scientific novelty. However, their novel contributions are devalued and discounted: For example, novel contributions by gender and racial minorities are taken up by other scholars at lower rates than novel contributions by gender and racial majorities, and equally impactful contributions of gender and racial minorities are less likely to result in successful scientific careers than for majority groups. These results suggest there may be unwarranted reproduction of stratification in academic careers that discounts diversity’s role in innovation and partly explains the underrepresentation of some groups in academia.},

	abstract = {Climate change has profound effects on infectious disease dynamics, yet the impacts of increased short-term temperature fluctuations on disease spread remain poorly understood. We empirically tested the theoretical prediction that short-term thermal fluctuations suppress endemic infection prevalence at the pathogen’s thermal optimum. This prediction follows from a mechanistic disease transmission model analyzed using stochastic simulations of the model parameterized with thermal performance curves (TPCs) from metabolic scaling theory and using nonlinear averaging, which predicts ecological outcomes consistent with Jensen’s inequality (i.e., reduced performance around concave-down portions of a thermal response curve). Experimental observations of replicated epidemics of the microparasite Ordospora colligata in Daphnia magna populations indicate that temperature variability had the opposite effect of our theoretical predictions and instead increase endemic infection prevalence. This positive effect of temperature variability is qualitatively consistent with a published hypothesis that parasites may acclimate more rapidly to fluctuating temperatures than their hosts; however, incorporating hypothetical effects of delayed host acclimation into the mechanistic transmission model did not fully account for the observed pattern. The experimental data indicate that shifts in the distribution of infection burden underlie the positive effect of temperature fluctuations on endemic prevalence. The increase in disease risk associated with climate fluctuations may therefore result from disease processes interacting across scales, particularly within-host dynamics, that are not captured by combining standard transmission models with metabolic scaling theory.},

Warmer temperatures were associated with lower structural and temporal stability, while biodiversity had no consistent effects on either stability property. While species richness was associated with lower structural stability and higher temporal stability, Simpson diversity was associated with higher temporal stability. The responses of structural stability were linked to disproportionate contributions from two trophic groups (predators and consumers), while the responses of temporal stability were linked both to synchrony of all species within the food web and distinctive contributions from three trophic groups (predators, consumers, and producers).

The resulting dataset encompasses 663 taxonomic groups (at Family or higher taxonomic rank) ranging from microorganisms to mammals. We inferred changes in the composition of communities, revealing putative interactions among taxa and identifying correlations between these communities and environmental properties over time. Community network analysis provided evidence of expected predator-prey relationships, trophic linkages, and seasonal shifts across all domains of life.

	abstract = {Parasite transmission between farmed and wild salmon affects the sustainability of salmon aquaculture in Pacific Canada. Understanding and managing parasites in aquaculture is challenged by spatial and temporal variation in transmission dynamics. We developed a mechanistic model that connects sea louse (Lepeoptheirus salmonis) outbreak and control on farmed salmon (Salmo salar) to spatiotemporal dynamics of sea lice on migrating wild juvenile salmon (Oncorhynchus keta and Oncorhynchus gorbuscha). We fitted the model to time series of sea lice on farmed salmon and spatial surveys of juvenile wild salmon in the Broughton Archipelago. We used the parameterized model to evaluate alternative management scenarios based on the resulting sea louse infestations and predicted mortality of wild salmon. Early and coordinated management of sea lice on salmon farms was most effective for controlling outbreaks in wild salmon, while uncoordinated treatments led to a resurgence of sea lice on salmon farms during the juvenile salmon migration. This study highlights the importance of incorporating spatiotemporal variability when considering infectious disease dynamics shared by farmed and wild hosts, particularly when migratory wildlife are involved.},

	abstract = {Parasites can, in theory, have large impacts on the survival of fish populations. One method to evaluate such impacts on anadromous species is to apply manipulative field experiments in which parallel groups of antiparasitically treated and non-treated fish are simultaneously released and then subsequently recaptured as returning adults. A systematic review and meta-analysis on all such Norwegian studies on Salmo salar provided a data set for the time period 1996 to 2011 on 118 release groups comprising 657 624 fish released and 3989 recaptured. The overall risk ratio (RR) was estimated to be 1.18 (95\% CI: 1.07–1.30). The effect varied strongly between groups, (Higgins I2 = 40.1\%). Over 70\% of this heterogeneity could be explained by the release location, time period and baseline survival. The most important predictor variable was baseline survival. In groups with low recapture in the control group (low baseline survival), the effect of treatment was high (RR = 1.7), while in groups with high recapture in the control group (high baseline survival), there was no effect of treatment (RR 1.00). The most prevalent parasite in the region affected by the drugs administered was Lepeophtheirus salmonis. Hence, the meta-analysis supports the hypothesis that L. salmonis contributes to the mortality of S. salar during outward migration. However, the effect of treatment was not consistent, but was evidently strongly modulated by other risk factors. The results suggest that the population-level effects of parasites cannot be estimated independently of other factors affecting the marine survival of S. salar.},

Uncovering the network architecture of such trophic interactions has been recognized as the essential step for exploring species with great impacts on ecosystem-level phenomena and functions. However, it has remained a major challenge to reveal how species-rich networks of predator–prey interactions are continually reshaped through time in the wild. Here, we show that dynamics of species-rich predator–prey interactions can be characterized by remarkable network structural changes and alternations of species with greatest impacts on community processes. On the basis of high-throughput detection of prey DNA from 1,556 spider individuals collected in a grassland ecosystem, we reconstructed dynamics of interaction networks involving, in total, 50 spider species and 974 prey species and strains through 8 months. The networks were compartmentalized into modules (groups) of closely interacting predators and prey in each month. Those modules differed in detritus/grazing food chain properties, forming complex fission–fusion dynamics of belowground and aboveground energy channels across the seasons. The substantial shifts of network structure entailed alternations of spider species located at the core positions within the entangled webs of interactions. These results indicate that knowledge of dynamically shifting food webs is crucial for understanding temporally varying roles of ‘core species’ in ecosystem processes.},

The physical factors and the changes to ocean chemistry that they drive can all be measured with great precision. Changes in the biological composition of communities in different ocean regions are far more challenging to measure because most biological monitoring methods focus on a limited taxonomic or size range. Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis has the potential to solve this problem in biological oceanography, as it is capable of identifying a huge phylogenetic range of organisms to species level. Here we develop and apply a novel multi-gene molecular toolkit to eDNA isolated from bulk plankton samples collected over a five-year period from a single site. This temporal scale and level of detail is unprecedented in eDNA studies. We identified consistent seasonal assemblages of zooplankton species, which demonstrates the ability of our toolkit to audit community composition. We were also able to detect clear departures from the regular seasonal patterns that occurred during an extreme marine heatwave. The integration of eDNA analyses with existing biotic and abiotic surveys delivers a powerful new long-term approach to monitoring the health of our world’s oceans in the context of a rapidly changing climate.},

The result is a high-resolution picture of changes in ecological communities using a technique replicable across a wide variety of ecosystems. We estimate community-level differences associated with time, space and environmental variables, and use these results to forecast near-term community changes due to warming and ocean acidification. We find distinct communities in warmer and more acidified conditions, with overall reduced richness in diatom assemblages and increased richness in dinoflagellates. Individual taxa finding more suitable habitat in near-future waters are more taxonomically varied and include the ubiquitous coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi and the harmful dinoflagellate Alexandrium sp.

	abstract = {The effects of temperature on interaction strengths are important for understanding and forecasting how global climate change impacts marine ecosystems; however, tracking and quantifying interactions of marine fish species are practically difficult especially under field conditions, and thus, how temperature influences their interaction strengths under field conditions remains poorly understood. We herein performed quantitative fish environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding on 550 seawater samples that were collected twice a month from 11 coastal sites for 2 years in the Boso Peninsula, Japan, and analyzed eDNA monitoring data using nonlinear time series analytical tools. We detected fish–fish interactions as information flow between eDNA time series, reconstructed interaction networks for the top 50 frequently detected species, and quantified pairwise, fluctuating interaction strengths. Although there was a large variation, water temperature influenced fish–fish interaction strengths. The impact of water temperature on interspecific interaction strengths varied among fish species, suggesting that fish species identity influences the temperature effects on interactions. For example, interaction strengths that Halichoeres tenuispinis and Microcanthus strigatus received strongly increased with water temperature, while those of Engraulis japonicus and Girella punctata decreased with water temperature. An increase in water temperature induced by global climate change may change fish interactions in a complex way, which consequently influences marine community dynamics and stability. Our research demonstrates a practical research framework to study the effects of environmental variables on interaction strengths of marine communities in nature, which would contribute to understanding and predicting natural marine ecosystem dynamics.},

Nevertheless, understanding long-term dynamics is important for explaining present-day biodiversity patterns and placing conservation goals in a historical context. Here, we use recent examples and new perspectives to highlight how environmental DNA (eDNA) is starting to provide a powerful new source of temporal data for research questions that have so far been overlooked, by helping to resolve the ecological dynamics of populations, communities, and ecosystems over hundreds to thousands of years. We give examples of hypotheses that may be addressed by temporal eDNA biodiversity data, discuss possible research directions, and outline related challenges. Highlights eDNA fills an important data gap for temporal ecology: it provides data over long time periods with high taxonomic breadth, permitting tests of hypotheses and models of biodiversity. Dynamic biodiversity data obtained with eDNA have the potential to reveal the long-term dynamics of populations, species, communities, and ecosystems in changing environments. eDNA records both ecological and evolutionary changes and thus may be used to understand eco-evolutionary feedbacks. Models of how historical environmental changes impact biodiversity may be hindcast validated with eDNA. Important challenges remain concerning the deposition and preservation of eDNA, the nature of different eDNA archives, and the interpretation of the resulting biodiversity data.},

	abstract = {It is now clear that fished populations can fluctuate more than unharvested stocks. However, it is not clear why. Here we distinguish among three major competing mechanisms for this phenomenon, by using the 50-year California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) larval fish record. First, variable fishing pressure directly increases variability in exploited populations. Second, commercial fishing can decrease the average body size and age of a stock, causing the truncated population to track environmental fluctuations directly. Third, age-truncated or juvenescent populations have increasingly unstable population dynamics because of changing demographic parameters such as intrinsic growth rates. We find no evidence for the first hypothesis, limited evidence for the second and strong evidence for the third. Therefore, in California Current fisheries, increased temporal variability in the population does not arise from variable exploitation, nor does it reflect direct environmental tracking. More fundamentally, it arises from increased instability in dynamics. This finding has implications for resource management as an empirical example of how selective harvesting can alter the basic dynamics of exploited populations, and lead to unstable booms and busts that can precede systematic declines in stock levels.},

	abstract = {Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) are exposed to increased environmental change and multiple human stressors. To anticipate future impacts of global change and to improve sustainable resource management, it is critical to understand how wild salmon populations respond to stressors associated with human-caused changes such as climate warming and ocean acidification, as well as competition in the ocean, which is intensified by the large-scale production and release of hatchery reared salmon. Pink salmon (O. gorbuscha) are a keystone species in the North Pacific Ocean and support highly valuable commercial fisheries. We investigated the joint effects of changes in ocean conditions and salmon abundances on the productivity of wild pink salmon. Our analysis focused on Prince William Sound in Alaska, because the region accounts for 50\% of the global production of hatchery pink salmon with local hatcheries releasing 600–700 million pink salmon fry annually. Using 60 years of data on wild pink salmon abundances, hatchery releases, and ecological conditions in the ocean, we find evidence that hatchery pink salmon releases negatively affect wild pink salmon productivity, likely through competition between wild and hatchery juveniles in nearshore marine habitats. We find no evidence for effects of ocean acidification on pink salmon productivity. However, a change in the leading mode of North Pacific climate in 1988–1989 weakened the temperature–productivity relationship and altered the strength of intraspecific density dependence. Therefore, our results suggest non-stationary (i.e., time varying) and interactive effects of ocean climate and competition on pink salmon productivity. Our findings further highlight the need for salmon management to consider potential adverse effects of large-scale hatchery production within the context of ocean change.},

In retrospective performance testing individual models were capable of reducing pre-season forecast error at the river system level by on average 15\% relative to a benchmark model. We used an ensemble modeling approach to produce pre-season forecasts based on historical performance of individual models. This ensemble model reduced river system forecast error by 13\% on average in 5 of the 7 evaluated river systems, though it increased forecast error by 39\% on average in the remaining 2 systems. We found potential for modest improvements in forecast accuracy across a variety of scales.

Classical univariate approaches, which require time-series observations of only a single focal variable, can produce verifiable out-of-sample forecasts; however, they can sometimes require long time series that may be difficult to obtain. More importantly, classical approaches limit the depth of mechanistic understanding that can be gained and the generalizability of forecasts to non-analogue futures. We review the main ideas of EDM and more recent extensions that expand their capabilities for improving forecasts and understanding mechanism. Algorithms are now available that allow for missing data, unequal sampling intervals and combining short time series, which increase the number of datasets that can be used. Recent extensions of EDM to multivariate time series substantially expand the range of applications and mechanistic questions that can be addressed, including detecting causal coupling, tracking changing interactions in real time, leveraging short time series from information shared in coupled variables, modelling dynamically changing stability, scenario exploration, and management applications involving optimal control.},

	abstract = {Natural systems are often complex and dynamic (i.e. nonlinear), making them difficult to understand using linear statistical approaches. Linear approaches are fundamentally based on correlation. Thus, they are ill-posed for dynamical systems, where correlation can occur without causation, and causation may also occur in the absence of correlation. “Mirage correlation” (i.e., the sign and magnitude of the correlation change with time) is a hallmark of nonlinear systems that results from state dependency. State dependency means that the relationships among interacting variables change with different states of the system. In recent decades, nonlinear methods that acknowledge state dependence have been developed. These nonlinear statistical methods are rooted in state space reconstruction, i.e. lagged coordinate embedding of time series data. These methods do not assume any set of equations governing the system but recover the dynamics from time series data, thus called empirical dynamic modeling (EDM). EDM bears a variety of utilities to investigating dynamical systems. Here, we provide a step-by-step tutorial for EDM applications with rEDM, a free software package written in the R language. Using model examples, we aim to guide users through several basic applications of EDM, including (1) determining the complexity (dimensionality) of a system, (2) distinguishing nonlinear dynamical systems from linear stochastic systems, and quantifying the nonlinearity (i.e. state dependence), (3) determining causal variables, (4) forecasting, (5) tracking the strength and sign of interaction, and (6) exploring the scenario of external perturbation. These methods and applications can be used to provide a mechanistic understanding of dynamical systems.},

Though detectable in principle, nonlinear behavior is often difficult to characterize, analyze, and incorporate mechanistically into models of ecosystem function. One obvious reason is that quantitative nonlinear analysis tools are data intensive (require long time series), and time series in ecology are generally short. Here we demonstrate a useful method that circumvents data limitation and reduces sampling error by combining ecologically similar multispecies time series into one long time series. With this technique, individual ecological time series containing as few as 20 data points can be mined for such important information as (1) significantly improved forecast ability, (2) the presence and location of nonlinearity, and (3) the effective dimensionality (the number of relevant variables) of an ecological system.},

We conducted a factorial experiment on the population dynamics of Daphnia magna in relation to size-selective harvesting and stochasticity of food supply. Harvesting and stochasticity treatments both increased population fluctuations. Timeseries analysis indicated that fluctuations in control populations were non-linear, and non-linearity increased substantially in response to harvesting. Both harvesting and stochasticity induced population juvenescence, but harvesting did so via the depletion of adults, whereas stochasticity increased the abundance of juveniles. A fitted fisheries model indicated that harvesting shifted populations towards higher reproductive rates and larger-magnitude damped oscillations that amplify demographic noise. These findings provide experimental evidence that harvesting increases the non-linearity of population fluctuations and that both harvesting and stochasticity increase population variability and juvenescence.},

Because it makes no assumptions concerning the structural form of ecological processes, it can provide an effective approach to dealing with model uncertainty. The method uses non-linear, non-parametric models. It can accommodate a wide spectrum of dynamical behaviors and makes no equilibrium assumptions. The approach is predicated on the idea that within a time series of observations of an ecological variable (e.g. population or species abundance) is encoded information on the factors that have affected that variable over time (e.g. the effects of predators or prey, competitors, environmental change, etc.). The method employs state-space reconstruction to decode this embedded information, and applies nearest-neighbor and kernel regression methods of forecasting. Forecast skill is used directly as a criterion for model selection and validation. It has been proven effective in application to fisheries forecasting problems, often outperforming standard modeling approaches.},

However, these pose a challenge to existing methods that can quantify only small interaction networks. Here, we proposed a novel approach to reconstruct high-dimensional interaction Jacobian networks using empirical time series without specific model assumptions. This method, named “multiview distance regularised S-map,” generalised the state space reconstruction to accommodate high dimensionality and overcome difficulties in quantifying massive interactions with limited data. When evaluating this method using time series generated from theoretical models involving hundreds of interacting species, estimated strengths of interaction Jacobians were in good agreement with theoretical expectations. Applying this method to a natural bacterial community helped identify important species from the interaction network and revealed mechanisms governing the dynamical stability of a bacterial community. The proposed method overcame the challenge of high dimensionality in large natural dynamical systems.},

	abstract = {State–space models (SSMs) are an important modeling framework for analyzing ecological time series. These hierarchical models are commonly used to model population dynamics, animal movement, and capture–recapture data, and are now increasingly being used to model other ecological processes. SSMs are popular because they are flexible and they model the natural variation in ecological processes separately from observation error. Their flexibility allows ecologists to model continuous, count, binary, and categorical data with linear or nonlinear processes that evolve in discrete or continuous time. Modeling the two sources of stochasticity separately allows researchers to differentiate between biological variation and imprecision in the sampling methodology, and generally provides better estimates of the ecological quantities of interest than if only one source of stochasticity is directly modeled. Since the introduction of SSMs, a broad range of fitting procedures have been proposed. However, the variety and complexity of these procedures can limit the ability of ecologists to formulate and fit their own SSMs. We provide the knowledge for ecologists to create SSMs that are robust to common, and often hidden, estimation problems, and the model selection and validation tools that can help them assess how well their models fit their data. We present a review of SSMs that will provide a strong foundation to ecologists interested in learning about SSMs, introduce new tools to veteran SSM users, and highlight promising research directions for statisticians interested in ecological applications. The review is accompanied by an in-depth tutorial that demonstrates how SSMs can be fitted and validated in R. Together, the review and tutorial present an introduction to SSMs that will help ecologists to formulate, fit, and validate their models.},

	abstract = {Marine biodiversity is a key indicator of ecosystem health and can be assessed using a variety of methods, including environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling. However, the ecology of eDNA in physically dynamic nearshore environments remains uncertain, particularly with regards to how eDNA stratifies with depth. Here, we paired eDNA sampling with dive surveys at six sites in Knight Inlet, British Columbia, Canada. eDNA samples were collected from the surface, midwater column and bottom (8–25 m depth) at each site, while dive surveys focused on the bottom (benthic) habitat. Amplicon sequencing using the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene (targeting fish) and the COI gene (targeting marine invertebrates and algae) resolved significant differences in community composition in surface waters compared with midwater and bottom. Differences by depth were greater than differences across sites, with surface waters dominated by salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) and rotifer DNA, and midwater and bottom samples largely dominated by Pacific herring, copepods, and mussels. eDNA samples collected at the surface, therefore, may not accurately capture benthic communities, particularly in systems with high levels of freshwater input such as coastal temperate fjords. Over small spatial scales, particularly in systems with strong stratification, adding samples from different depths may be more effective at maximizing inferred diversity rather than sampling more sites. In general, there was low overlap in species detection between dive and eDNA surveys (less than 10\% for each taxonomic group – fish, invertebrates, and algae). However, we observed clear strengths for each method – dive surveys provided better taxonomic resolution, while eDNA resolved greater total diversity. These results suggest that the two survey methods can be used in tandem to provide distinct and complementary snapshots of marine biodiversity in the nearshore environment.},

Open net-pen salmon farms in British Columbia, Canada, routinely illuminate their net-pens during the winter and spring, with unknown consequences on the abundance and distribution of marine fish and invertebrates. Paired lit and control samples consisting of plankton hauls and purse seines were made around a 400 W underwater light such as those used on salmon farms. On lit nights, invertebrates were marginally more abundant, while fish larvae and juvenile and adult fish were significantly more abundant. In particular, the invertebrate taxa Gastropoda and Bivalvia were significantly more abundant on lit nights, as were the fish species Pacific herring Clupea pallasi, sand lance Ammodytes hexapterus, threespine stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus, soft sculpin Psychrolutes sigalutes, and great sculpin larvae Myoxocephalus polyacanthocephalus. These results suggest that lights commonly used in open net-pen aquaculture may increase the abundance of some fish species around pens, thereby increasing the probability that farmed fish and wild species directly and indirectly interact in coastal marine environments.},

	abstract = {Coastal aquaculture activities influence wild macrofauna in natural environments due to the introduction of artificial structures, such as floating cages, that provide structural complexity in the pelagic system. This alters the abundance and distribution of the affected species and also their feeding behaviour and diet. Despite this, the effects of coastal aquaculture on zooplankton assemblages and the potential changes in their abundance and distribution remain largely unstudied. Traditional plankton sampling hauls between the farm mooring systems entail some practical difficulties. As an alternative, light traps were deployed at 2 farms in the SW Mediterranean during a whole warm season. Total zooplankton capture by traps at farms was higher than at control locations on every sampling night. It ranged from 3 to 10 times higher for the taxonomic groups: bivalvia, cladocera, cumacea, fish early-life-stages, gastropoda, polychaeta and tanaidacea; 10–20 times higher for amphipoda, chaetognatha, isopoda, mysidacea and ostracoda, and 22 times higher for copepoda and the crustacean juvenile stages zoea and megalopa. Permutational analysis showed significant differences for the most abundant zooplankton groups (copepoda, crustacean larvae, chaetognatha, cladocera, mysidacea and polychaeta). This marked incremental increase in zooplankton taxa at farms was consistent, irrespective of the changing environmental variables registered every night. Reasons for the greater abundance of zooplankton at farms are discussed, although results suggest a retention effect caused by cage structures rather than active attraction through physical or chemical cues.},

Cypermethrin and emamectin benzoate are the active ingredients in Excis and Slice respectively, which are widely used to control ectoparasitic sea lice on farmed salmon. Excis and Slice treatments did not cause basin-wide effects on the zooplankton community. For both formulations, no adverse affects on zooplankton were detected, instead observed changes in zooplankton abundance and community composition displayed natural seasonal cycles of abundance. Water column concentrations of cypermethrin and emamectin benzoate following sea lice treatments at the fish farm were predicted using models. Cypermethrin concentrations of 3000ng/l were predicted for short periods immediately after each cage treatment assuming no particle adhesion. The 3-h and 24-h Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) were exceeded for 10h and 32h respectively on the second day when five cages were treated. However, cypermethrin concentrations higher than 0.5ng/l (24-h EQS) were predicted to occur over {\textless}2\% of the total basin area on each treatment day. The 3-h EQS (16ng/l) was exceeded in {\textless}0.3\% of the basin on each treatment day. The concentration of soluble emamectin benzoate present in the water column was predicted from modelled deposition footprints and sediment concentrations to be of order 10{\textasciicircum}-{\textasciicircum}3ng/l. Predicted concentrations of both chemicals were generally lower than those causing toxicity to copepods in previous laboratory studies and further support the results of this field study that environmental concentrations of Excis and Slice do not adversely impact zooplankton communities.},

In particular, when the standard models themselves are inadequate (von Bertalanffy, extended Ricker etc.) no additional data will improve performance. By using time series from the Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Science Continuous Plankton Recorder, we demonstrate that long-term observations reveal both the prevalence of nonlinear processes in species abundances and an improvement in out-of-sample predictability as the number of observations increase. The empirical results presented here quantitatively demonstrate the importance of long-term temporal data collection programs for improving ecosystem models and forecasts, and to better support environmental management actions.},

	abstract = {Empirical dynamic modeling (EDM) is a powerful method for forecasting and analyzing nonlinear dynamics. However, typical applications of EDM assume that samples are evenly spaced over time. This presents problems in ecology, in which data are often missing or sampled irregularly. Standard methods for handling irregularity in EDM suffer under conditions that are common in ecology, such as short time series and large dynamic fluctuations, so there is a need to adapt the framework to cope with these challenges more effectively. Here we consider a variable step-size extension of EDM, which incorporates the temporal spacing between samples into EDM delay-coordinate vectors and circumvents the challenges faced by other approaches. We evaluated the forecast accuracy of the variable step-size method along with that of two other methods: (1) exclusion of delay-coordinate vectors with missing data and (2) linear interpolation along with ordinary EDM. We tested these methods using simulated data from three chaotic ecological models with various amounts and patterns of missing data. We also evaluated them using two empirical datasets: laboratory rotifer dynamics and aphid dynamics from the field. Results showed that while exclusion and linear interpolation can produce accurate forecasts in some scenarios, the variable step-size method consistently gives accurate forecasts in a wide range of scenarios. Our analysis demonstrates that variable step-size EDM is an effective method for coping with missing or irregular samples and expands the number of datasets to which EDM can be applied. Furthermore, EDM can be extended to estimate Lyapunov exponents from irregularly sampled time series and approximate continuous dynamics from discrete-time data.},

	abstract = {It is well known that current equilibrium-based models fall short as predictive descriptions of natural ecosystems, and particularly of fisheries systems that exhibit nonlinear dynamics. For example, model parameters assumed to be fixed constants may actually vary in time, models may fit well to existing data but lack out-of-sample predictive skill, and key driving variables may be misidentified due to transient (mirage) correlations that are common in nonlinear systems. With these frailties, it is somewhat surprising that static equilibrium models continue to be widely used. Here, we examine empirical dynamic modeling (EDM) as an alternative to imposed model equations and that accommodates both nonequilibrium dynamics and nonlinearity. Using time series from nine stocks of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) from the Fraser River system in British Columbia, Canada, we perform, for the the first time to our knowledge, real-data comparison of contemporary fisheries models with equivalent EDM formulations that explicitly use spawning stock and environmental variables to forecast recruitment. We find that EDM models produce more accurate and precise forecasts, and unlike extensions of the classic Ricker spawner–recruit equation, they show significant improvements when environmental factors are included. Our analysis demonstrates the strategic utility of EDM for incorporating environmental influences into fisheries forecasts and, more generally, for providing insight into how environmental factors can operate in forecast models, thus paving the way for equation-free mechanistic forecasting to be applied in management contexts.},

	abstract = {Applications of environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis methods for biomonitoring have grown exponentially over the last decade and provide a wealth of new information on the distribution of species. However, eDNA methods have limited application for estimating population-level metrics. Environmental RNA (eRNA) has the potential to address ecological questions by gathering population demographic information from environmental media but may be challenging to detect and analyze. We developed gene-specific eRNA assays targeting keratin-associated genes in two focal species, American bullfrogs (Lithobates catesbeianus) and tiger salamanders (Ambystoma mavortium) to answer an important question in amphibian management: whether species detections represent breeding populations versus transitory adults. We performed an extensive laboratory validation with amphibians housed across development stages, where we collected 95 and 127 environmental samples for bullfrogs and salamanders, respectively. Both assays were highly specific to the larval stage and amplified with high sensitivity (90\% in bullfrog and 88.4\% in tiger salamander samples). We then applied our validated assays to multiple natural systems. When larvae were present, we found 74.1\% overall detection in bullfrog field samples and 70.8\% and 48.5\% overall detection in field samples from ponds with A. macrodactylum and A. californiense larvae, correlating with eDNA detection rates. When only adults were present, we did not detect larvae-specific eRNA in A. macrodactylum ponds, despite high eDNA detection rates. Although much work is ahead for optimizing assay design, sampling and filtering methods, we demonstrate that eRNA can successfully be used to discern life stages with direct application for ecology and conservation management.},

	abstract = {Global declines in insects have sparked wide interest among scientists, politicians, and the general public. Loss of insect diversity and abundance is expected to provoke cascading effects on food webs and to jeopardize ecosystem services. Our understanding of the extent and underlying causes of this decline is based on the abundance of single species or taxonomic groups only, rather than changes in insect biomass which is more relevant for ecological functioning. Here, we used a standardized protocol to measure total insect biomass using Malaise traps, deployed over 27 years in 63 nature protection areas in Germany (96 unique location-year combinations) to infer on the status and trend of local entomofauna. Our analysis estimates a seasonal decline of 76\%, and mid-summer decline of 82\% in flying insect biomass over the 27 years of study. We show that this decline is apparent regardless of habitat type, while changes in weather, land use, and habitat characteristics cannot explain this overall decline. This yet unrecognized loss of insect biomass must be taken into account in evaluating declines in abundance of species depending on insects as a food source, and ecosystem functioning in the European landscape.},

	abstract = {Molecular techniques using DNA retrieved from community or environmental samples, in particular environmental DNA (eDNA), are becoming increasingly popular for detecting individual species, assessing biodiversity, and quantifying ecological indices. More recently, eDNA has also been proposed as a template for population genetics, and several studies have already tested the feasibility of this approach, mostly looking at vertebrate species. Their results along with general opportunities offered by these types of “community-based” samples, such as the possibility to target multiple species at the same time, have generated great enthusiasm and expectations for using eDNA in population genetics. However, not every aspect of population genetics can be addressed by eDNA-based data and some inherent limitations may challenge its conclusions. Here, we firstly review the state of current knowledge of DNA retrieved from environmental and community samples for population genetics. Then, focusing on eDNA, we summarize the opportunities but also detail four main limitations of its use for population-level inferences, namely, (1) the difficulty to retrieve a species-specific dataset, (2) the potential lack of correlation between observed and true allelic frequencies, (3) the loss of individual information in multi-locus genotyping and linkage between loci, and (4) the uncertainty about the individuals contributing to the sampled DNA pool (e.g., number, life-stage, or sex). Some of these limitations might be overcome with the development of new technologies or models that account for the specificities of eDNA. Others, however, are inherent, and their effect on the inferences must be thoroughly evaluated. The possibility of gaining insights into genetic diversity and population structure from DNA retrieved from community and environmental samples is appealing for scientists, conservation managers, and other practitioners. Yet, to avoid false expectations and incorrect inferences, it is imperative that these limitations are known and considered alongside the opportunities and advantages.},

Does the diversity paradox hold for scientists as well? We study this by utilizing a near-complete population of ∼1.2 million US doctoral recipients from 1977 to 2015 and following their careers into publishing and faculty positions. We use text analysis and machine learning to answer a series of questions: How do we detect scientific innovations? Are underrepresented groups more likely to generate scientific innovations? And are the innovations of underrepresented groups adopted and rewarded? Our analyses show that underrepresented groups produce higher rates of scientific novelty. However, their novel contributions are devalued and discounted: For example, novel contributions by gender and racial minorities are taken up by other scholars at lower rates than novel contributions by gender and racial majorities, and equally impactful contributions of gender and racial minorities are less likely to result in successful scientific careers than for majority groups. These results suggest there may be unwarranted reproduction of stratification in academic careers that discounts diversity’s role in innovation and partly explains the underrepresentation of some groups in academia.},

In scholarly writing, authorship is widely acknowledged as a means of conferring credit but is also tied to concepts such as responsibility and accountability. Authorship is one of the most divisive topics both at the level of the research team and more broadly in the academy and beyond. At present, authorship is often the primary way to assert and receive credit in many scholarly pursuits and domains. Debates rage, publicly but mostly privately, regarding authorship. Here we attempt to clarify key concepts related to authorship informed by our collective experiences and anchored in relevant contemporary literature. Rather than dwelling on the problems, we focus on proactive strategies for creating more just, equitable, and transparent avenues for minimizing conflict around authorship and where there is adequate recognition of the entire process of knowledge generation, synthesis, sharing, and application with partners within and beyond the academy. We frame our ideas around 10 strategies that collectively constitute a roadmap for avoiding and overcoming challenges associated with authorship decisions.},

	abstract = {A critical part of science is the extraction of general principles by synthesizing results from many different studies or disciplines. In the fields of ecology and evolution, a popular method to conduct synthesis science is in working groups – that is, research collaborations based around intensive week-long meetings. We present in this report an analysis of the impact of working group participation and gender on the publication impact of ecology and evolution faculty at Canadian universities who were research active over the last three decades (N=1408). Women are underrepresented in this research population relative to the general population, and even the Canadian faculty population. Participation in working groups not only benefits science, but also benefits the researchers involved by accelerating the temporal increase in their H-index. However, this benefit is particularly driven by senior male researchers. The effect is weaker for female researchers and even negative for researchers within 4 years of their PhD. However, gender does not affect current participation rates in working groups, nor reported indirect benefits – such as future collaborations, funding and data resources. The results of this study suggest that working groups can act as career catalysts for researchers, but that – as in many areas of science – there are challenging issues of equity that require action. Because the H-index is a cumulative measure, gender inequities from before the turn of the millenium may still be distorting the perceived publication impact of today’s research-active faculty.},

We also discuss the future of eRNA as a means of assessing the physiological status of organisms and the ecological health of populations and communities, reflecting ecosystem-level conditions.

We show how a critical consideration of these assumptions can lead to biologically useful hypotheses and experimental designs. For example, rather than assuming that TPCs are fixed during ontogeny, one can measure TPCs for each major life stage and incorporate these into stage-specific ecological models to reveal the life stage most likely to be vulnerable to climate change. Our overall goal is to explicitly examine the assumptions underlying the integration of TPCs with Tb, to develop a framework within which empiricists can place their work within these limitations, and to facilitate the application of thermal physiology to understanding the biological implications of climate change.},

We summarize the likely impacts of climate change on the physical environment of salmon in the Pacific Northwest and discuss the potential evolutionary consequences of these changes, with particular reference to Columbia River Basin spring/summer Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka) salmon. We discuss the possible evolutionary responses in migration and spawning date egg and juvenile growth and development rates, thermal tolerance, and disease resistance. We know little about ocean migration pathways, so cannot confidently suggest the potential changes in this life stage. Climate change might produce conflicting selection pressures in different life stages, which will interact with plastic (i.e. nongenetic) changes in various ways. To clarify these interactions, we present a conceptual model of how changing environmental conditions shift phenotypic optima and, through plastic responses, phenotype distributions, affecting the force of selection. Our predictions are tentative because we lack data on the strength of selection, heritability, and ecological and genetic linkages among many of the traits discussed here. Despite the challenges involved in experimental manipulation of species with complex life histories, such research is essential for full appreciation of the biological effects of climate change.},

We reviewed 19 studies that provided 40 situations where male and female mortality could be directly compared. Female mortality averaged 2.1 times greater than that of males and up to eightfold higher. High female mortality was also evident in migrating coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) and Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and for sockeye salmon in other systems. Female mortality was highest when migration conditions were challenging (e.g., high or turbulent flows, high temperatures, confinement, or handling) and towards end of river migration. We review mechanisms for differential mortality, including energy exhaustion, cardiac performance, physiological stress, and immune factors. Female-specific mortality will become even more pronounced in coming years as ocean and riverine conditions continue to change.},

Environmental DNA approaches are increasingly used for species identification, but cannot provide functional insights. Transcriptomic methods reveal the physiological states of macroorganisms, but are currently species-specific and require tissue sampling or animal sacrifice, making community-wide assessments challenging. Here, we test whether broad functional information (expression level of the transcribed genes) can be harnessed from environmental RNA (eRNA), which includes extra-organismal RNA from macroorganisms along with whole microorganisms. We exposed Daphnia pulex as well as phytoplankton prey and microorganism colonizers to control (20°C) and heat stress (28°C) conditions for 7 days. We sequenced eRNA from tank water (after complete removal of Daphnia) as well as RNA from Daphnia tissue, enabling comparisons of extra-organismal and organismal RNA-based gene expression profiles. Both RNA types detected similar heat stress responses of Daphnia. Using eRNA, we identified 32 Daphnia genes to be differentially expressed following heat stress. Of these, 17 were also differentially expressed and exhibited similar levels of relative expression in organismal RNA. In addition to the extra-organismal Daphnia response, eRNA detected community-wide heat stress responses consisting of distinct functional profiles and 121 differentially expressed genes across eight taxa. Our study demonstrates that environmental transcriptomics based on extra-organismal eRNA can noninvasively reveal gene expression responses of macroorganisms following environmental changes, with broad potential implications for the biomonitoring of health across the trophic chain.},

	abstract = {Organism abundance is a critical parameter in ecology, but its estimation is often challenging. Approaches utilizing eDNA to indirectly estimate abundance have recently generated substantial interest. However, preliminary correlations observed between eDNA concentration and abundance in nature are typically moderate in strength with significant unexplained variation. Here, we apply a novel approach to integrate allometric scaling coefficients into models of eDNA concentration and organism abundance. We hypothesize that eDNA particle production scales nonlinearly with mass, with scaling coefficients {\textless} 1. Wild populations often exhibit substantial variation in individual body size distributions; we therefore predict that the distribution of mass across individuals within a population will influence population-level eDNA production rates. To test our hypothesis, we collected standardized body size distribution and mark–recapture abundance data using whole-lake experiments involving nine populations of brook trout. We correlated eDNA concentration with three metrics of abundance: density (individuals/ha), biomass (kg/ha) and allometrically scaled mass (ASM) (∑(individual mass0.73)/ha). Density and biomass were both significantly positively correlated with eDNA concentration (adj. r2 = 0.59 and 0.63, respectively), but ASM exhibited improved model fit (adj. r2 = 0.78). We also demonstrate how estimates of ASM derived from eDNA samples in 'unknown' systems can be converted to biomass or density estimates with additional size-structure data. Future experiments should empirically validate allometric scaling coefficients for eDNA production, particularly where substantial intraspecific size distribution variation exists. Incorporating allometric scaling may improve predictive models to the extent that eDNA concentration may become a reliable indicator of abundance in nature.},

	abstract = {Advances in environmental DNA (eDNA) methodologies have led to improvements in the ability to detect species and communities in aquatic environments, yet the majority of studies emphasize biological diversity at the species level by targeting variable sites within the mitochondrial genome. Here, we demonstrate that eDNA approaches also have the capacity to detect intraspecific diversity in the nuclear genome, allowing for assessments of population-level allele frequencies and estimates of the number of genetic contributors in an eDNA sample. Using a panel of microsatellite loci developed for the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), we tested the similarity between eDNA-based and individual tissue-based estimates of allele frequencies from experimental mesocosms and in a field-based trial. Subsequently, we used a likelihood-based DNA mixture framework to estimate the number of unique genetic contributors in eDNA samples and in simulated mixtures of alleles. In both mesocosm and field samples, allele frequencies from eDNA were highly correlated with allele frequencies from genotyped round goby tissue samples, indicating nuclear markers can be reliably amplified from water samples. DNA mixture analyses were able to estimate the number of genetic contributors from mesocosm eDNA samples and simulated mixtures of DNA from up to 58 individuals, with the degree of positive or negative bias dependent on the filtering scheme of low-frequency alleles. With this study we document the application of eDNA and multiple amplicon-based methods to obtain intraspecific nuclear genetic information and estimate the absolute abundance of a species in eDNA samples. With proper validation, this approach has the potential to advance noninvasive survey methods to characterize populations and detect population-level genetic diversity.},

	abstract = {During the outmigration of Pacific Salmon, the early marine phase is a critical period when high mortality can occur. Traditional sampling and monitoring of juvenile salmon migration can be limited by logistically intensive gear requirements, accessibility, and cost. Improved understanding of the early marine phase, for example, migration duration and habitat use, requires innovative techniques that can improve the spatial and temporal coverage of monitoring. Environmental DNA (eDNA) is genetic fragments present in the environment that can be used as a proxy for organism presence and can be effectively and efficiently collected through water samples. Estimating fish abundance or biomass from eDNA concentration data would provide a valuable fisheries tool but remains challenging to calibrate. To quantify the relationship between eDNA abundance and fish biomass, we used a controlled mesocosm experiment, in which eDNA samples were collected from 15 aquaria (340 L) with varying densities of juvenile Chinook salmon per tank (0, 5, 10, 20, and 30). The concentration of eDNA was obtained by qPCR scaled with fish biomass (ANOVA, p {\textless} 0.05). However, we also observed that variability of eDNA concentrations among replicates of the same treatment positively scaled biomass (ANOVA, p {\textless} 0.05). Therefore, higher biomasses of fish can yield more challenging data to interpret. This study lays important groundwork for the application of eDNA for monitoring juvenile salmonids yet highlights caveats for the applicability of eDNA as a stand-alone method to assess biomass in a field setting.},

Regular surveys provide essential information to establish strategies for the effective conservation of salmon resources. As an alternative to conventional fish surveys, which are costly and laborious, quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays were established for the analysis of four salmon species inhabiting the Korean Peninsula. We designed four species-specific primer sets that showed high specificity and sensitivity in both tissue and environmental DNA (eDNA) samples collected from the Yangyangnamdae River. After normalization for PCR inhibition in each sample, the established qPCR assays produced standardized and realistic eDNA profiles for the four salmon species, suggesting that the newly developed qPCR assays are a useful tool for the management of Oncorhynchus resources in Korean waters.

Abstract
A species-specific quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay using environmental DNA (eDNA) is a promising tool for both qualitative and quantitative analyses of target species directly from water samples. Despite its reliability, an eDNA-based qPCR assay pipeline has not yet developed to monitor salmon species inhabiting Korean waters, which have been rapidly decreasing. We designed species-specific primers for four Oncorhynchus species inhabiting the eastern coastal waters along the Korean Peninsula. These include primers for two native species (Oncorhynchus keta and O. masou) and two that were introduced (O. mykiss and O. kisutch). The limit of detection and limit of quantification for the four qPCR assays ranged from 4.11 to 10.38 copies and from 30 to 81 copies, respectively, indicating a high sensitivity and specificity across all four species. Following optimization, the qPCR assays were used for the quantitative analyses of the four Oncorhynchus species in the Yangyangnamdae River during the spawning and non-spawning seasons in the year 2019–2020, one of the main rivers where salmon migrate during the spawning season in Korea. The raw copy numbers in all of the examined samples were normalized by PCR inhibition rates to standardize and compare with other studies. Among the four Oncorhynchus species examined, the eDNA concentration of O. keta increased significantly (63.60-fold, p {\textless} 0.0001) during the spawning season (November) compared with that in the non-spawning season (March), suggesting that O. keta is the main salmon species migrating through the Yangyangnamdae River. In contrast, we did not detect any differences in eDNA concentration for the other three Oncorhynchus species between the spawning and non-spawning seasons, indicating that their presence does not alter during the year. Their eDNA concentration is also relatively low compared to O. keta, which suggests that small numbers of these three species are present in the river. Overall, these newly developed qPCR assays represent useful monitoring tools for the management of four salmon species in Korean waters.},

Here, we relate trends in species richness and abundance from 21,500 terrestrial and marine assemblage time series across temperate regions (23.5–60.0° latitude) to changes in air or sea surface temperature. We find a strong coupling between biodiversity and temperature changes in the marine realm, where species richness mostly increases with warming. However, biodiversity responses are conditional on the baseline climate, such that in initially warmer locations richness increase is more pronounced while abundance declines with warming. In contrast, we do not detect systematic temperature-related richness or abundance trends on land, despite a greater magnitude of warming. As the world is committed to further warming, substantial challenges remain in maintaining local biodiversity amongst the non-uniform inflow and outflow of ‘climate migrants’. Temperature-driven community restructuring is especially evident in the ocean, whereas climatic debt may be accumulating on land.},

This can obscure relationships between population dynamics and environmental variability, undermining our ability to forecast changes in populations tied to physical processes.

Using nonlinear forecasting models, we analysed over 200 time series of survey abundance and landings from two distinct ecosystems for patterns of dynamic complexity (dimensionality and nonlinear dynamics) and predictability. Differences in system dimensionality and nonlinear dynamics were associated with time series that reflected human intervention via fishing effort, implying the coupling between human and natural systems generated dynamics distinct from those detected in the natural resource subsystem alone. Estimated dimensionality was highest for landings and higher in abundance indices of unfished species than fished species. Fished species were more likely to display nonlinear dynamics than unfished species, and landings were significantly less predictable than abundance indices. Results were robust to variation in life history characteristics. Dynamics were predictable over a 1-year time horizon in seventy percent of time series, but predictability declined exponentially over a 5-year horizon. The ability to make predictions in fisheries systems is therefore extremely limited. To our knowledge, this is the first cross-system comparative study, and the first at the scale of individual species, to analyse empirically the dynamic complexity observed in fisheries data and to quantify predictability broadly. We outline one application of short-term forecasts to a precautionary approach to fisheries management that could improve how uncertainty and forecast error are incorporated into assessment through catch limit buffers.},

One consequence of migration common to marine fish and invertebrates is migratory allopatry—a period of spatial separation between adult and juvenile hosts, which is caused by host migration and which prevents parasite transmission from adult to juvenile hosts. We studied this characteristic for sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis and Caligus clemensi) and pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) from one of the Canada's largest salmon stocks. Migratory allopatry protects juvenile salmon from L. salmonis for two to three months of early marine life (2–3\% prevalence). In contrast, host diversity facilitates access for C. clemensi to juvenile salmon (8–20\% prevalence) but infections appear ephemeral. Aquaculture can augment host abundance and diversity and increase parasite exposure of wild juvenile fish. An empirically parametrized model shows high sensitivity of salmon populations to increased L. salmonis exposure, predicting population collapse at one to five motile L. salmonis per juvenile pink salmon. These results characterize parasite threats of salmon aquaculture to wild salmon populations and show how host migration and diversity are important factors affecting parasite transmission in the oceans.},

Despite this, we are not much closer to predicting recruitment. Rather, recent analyses suggest that recruitment is virtually independent of stock size and, instead, seems to occur in distinct environmental regimes. This issue of whether or not recruitment and subsequent production are coupled to stock size is highly relevant to management. Here, we apply empirical dynamical modelling (EDM) to a global database of 185 fish populations to address the questions of whether or not variation in recruitment is (a) predictable and (b) coupled to stock size. We find that a substantial fraction of recruitment variation is predictable using only the observed history of fluctuations ( 40\% on average). In addition, although recruitment is often coupled to stock size (107 of 185 stocks), stock size alone explains very little of the variation in recruitment; In 90\% of the stocks analysed, EDM forecasts have substantially lower prediction error than models based solely on stock size. We find that predictability varies across taxa and improves with the number of generations that have been sampled. In the light of these results, we suggest that EDM will be of greatest use in managing relatively short-lived species.},

In the central and western North Pacific along the Kuroshio-Oyashio Extension (KOE), the expression of these modes in SSH and SST is linked to the propagation of long oceanic Rossby waves, which extend the predictability of the climate system to {\textasciitilde}3 years. Using a multivariate physical-biological linear inverse model (LIM) we explore the extent to which this physical predictability leads to multi-year prediction of dominant fishery indicators inferred from three datasets (i.e., estimated biomasses, landings, and catches). We find that despite the strong autocorrelation in the fish indicators, the LIM adds dynamical forecast skill beyond persistence up to 5-6 years. By performing a sensitivity analysis of the LIM forecast model, we find that two main factors are essential for extending the dynamical predictability of the fishery indicators beyond persistence. The first is the interaction of the fishery indicators with the SST/SSH of the North and tropical Pacific. The second is the empirical relationship among the fisheries time series. This latter component reflects stock-stock interactions as well as common technological and human socioeconomic factors that may influence multiple fisheries and are captured in the training of the LIM. These results suggest that empirical dynamical models and machine learning algorithms, such as the LIM, provide an alternative and promising approach for forecasting key ecological indicators beyond the skill of persistence.},

The influence of sea surface temperature, which has been previously associated with larval growth and survival, was consistently detected in recruitment time series of bluefin tuna stocks that spawn in the Mediterranean Sea, the North Pacific, and the Southern Ocean. Short time series for the Gulf of Mexico stock may have precluded a clear determination of environmental influences on recruitment fluctuations. Because the non-parametric approach does not require specification of equations to represent system dynamics, predictive models can likely be developed that appropriately reflect the complexity of the ecological system under investigation. This flexibility can potentially overcome methodological challenges of specifying structural relationships between environmental conditions and fish recruitment. Consequently, there is potential for non-parametric time series modeling to supplement traditional stock recruitment models for fisheries management.},

	abstract = {Ecological communities are constantly being reshaped in the face of environmental change and anthropogenic pressures. Yet, how food webs change over time remains poorly understood. Food web science is characterized by a trade-off between complexity (in terms of the number of species and feeding links) and dynamics. Topological analysis can use complex, highly resolved empirical food web models to explore the architecture of feeding interactions but is limited to a static view, whereas ecosystem models can be dynamic but use highly aggregated food webs. Here, we explore the temporal dynamics of a highly resolved empirical food web over a time period of 18 years, using the German Bight fish and benthic epifauna community as our case study. We relied on long-term monitoring ecosystem surveys (from 1998 to 2015) to build a metaweb, i.e. the meta food web containing all species recorded over the time span of our study. We then combined time series of species abundances with topological network analysis to construct annual food web snapshots. We developed a new approach, ‘node-weighted’ food web metrics by including species abundances to represent the temporal dynamics of food web structure, focusing on generality and vulnerability. Our results suggest that structural food web properties change through time; however, binary food web structural properties may not be as temporally variable as the underlying changes in species composition. Further, the node-weighted metrics enabled us to detect that food web structure was influenced by changes in species composition during the first half of the time series and more strongly by changes in species dominance during the second half. Our results demonstrate how ecosystem surveys can be used to monitor temporal changes in food web structure, which are important ecosystem indicators for building marine management and conservation plans.},

	abstract = {A recurring pattern of declining mean trophic level of fisheries landings, termed “fishing down the food web,” is thought to be indicative of the serial replacement of high-trophic-level fisheries with less valuable, low-trophic-level fisheries as the former become depleted to economic extinction. An alternative to this view, that declining mean trophic levels indicate the serial addition of low-trophic-level fisheries (“fishing through the food web”), may be equally severe because it ultimately leads to conflicting demands for ecosystem services. By analyzing trends in fishery landings in 48 large marine ecosystems worldwide, we find that fishing down the food web was pervasive (present in 30 ecosystems) but that the sequential addition mechanism was by far the most common one underlying declines in the mean trophic level of landings. Specifically, only 9 ecosystems showed declining catches of upper-trophic-level species, compared with 21 ecosystems that exhibited either no significant change (n = 6) or significant increases (n = 15) in upper-trophic-level catches when fishing down the food web was occurring. Only in the North Atlantic were ecosystems regularly subjected to sequential collapse and replacement of fisheries. We suggest that efforts to promote sustainable use of marine resources will benefit from a fuller consideration of all processes giving rise to fishing down the food web.},

	abstract = {Nonlinear dynamics, where a change in the input is not proportional to a change in the output, are often found throughout nature, for example in biochemical kinetics. Because of the complex suite of interacting abiotic and biotic variables present in ecosystems, animal population dynamics are often thought to be driven in a nonlinear, state-dependent fashion. However, so far these have only been identified in model organisms and some natural systems. Here we show that nonlinear population dynamics are ubiquitous in nature. We use nonlinear forecasting to analyse 747 datasets of 228 species to find that insect population trends were highly nonlinear (74\%), followed by mammals (58\%), bony fish (49\%) and birds (35\%). This indicates that linear, equilibrium-based model assumptions may fail at predicting population dynamics across a wide range of animal taxa. We show that faster-reproducing animals are more likely to have nonlinear and high-dimensional dynamics, supporting past ecological theory. Lastly, only a third of time series were predictable beyond two years; therefore, the ability to predict animal population trends using these methods may be limited. Our results suggest that the complex dynamics necessary to cause regime shifts and other transitions may be inherent in a wide variety of animals.},

	abstract = {Studying how food web structure and function vary through time represents an opportunity to better comprehend and anticipate ecosystem changes. Yet, temporal studies of highly resolved food web structure are scarce. With few exceptions, most temporal food web studies are either too simplified, preventing a detailed assessment of structural properties or binary, missing the temporal dynamics of energy fluxes among species. Using long-term, multi-trophic biomass data coupled with highly resolved information on species feeding relationships, we analysed food web dynamics in the Gulf of Riga (Baltic Sea) over more than three decades (1981–2014). We combined unweighted (topology-based) and weighted (biomass- and flux-based) food web approaches, first, to unravel how distinct descriptors can highlight differences (or similarities) in food web dynamics through time, and second, to compare temporal dynamics of food web structure and function. We find that food web descriptors vary substantially and distinctively through time, likely reflecting different underlying ecosystem processes. While node- and link-weighted metrics reflect changes related to alterations in species dominance and fluxes, unweighted metrics are more sensitive to changes in species and link richness. Comparing unweighted, topology-based metrics and flux-based functions further indicates that temporal changes in functions cannot be predicted using unweighted food web structure. Rather, information on species population dynamics and weighted, flux-based networks should be included to better comprehend temporal food web dynamics. By integrating unweighted, node- and link-weighted metrics, we here demonstrate how different approaches can be used to compare food web structure and function, and identify complementary patterns of change in temporal food web dynamics, which enables a more complete understanding of the ecological processes at play in ecosystems undergoing change.},

	abstract = {Understanding the effects of cross-system fluxes is fundamental in ecosystem ecology and biological conservation. Source-sink dynamics and spillover processes may link adjacent ecosystems by movement of organisms across system boundaries. However, effects of temporal variability in these cross-system fluxes on a whole marine ecosystem structure have not yet been presented. Here we show, using 35 y of multitrophic data series from the Baltic Sea, that transitory spillover of the top-predator cod from its main distribution area produces cascading effects in the whole food web of an adjacent and semi-isolated ecosystem. At varying population size, cod expand/contract their distribution range and invade/retreat from the neighboring Gulf of Riga, thereby affecting the local prey population of herring and, indirectly, zooplankton and phytoplankton via top-down control. The Gulf of Riga can be considered for cod a “true sink” habitat, where in the absence of immigration from the source areas of the central Baltic Sea the cod population goes extinct due to the absence of suitable spawning grounds. Our results add a metaecosystem perspective to the ongoing intense scientific debate on the key role of top predators in structuring natural systems. The integration of regional and local processes is central to predict species and ecosystem responses to future climate changes and ongoing anthropogenic disturbances.},

We developed the first time-dynamic food web model for the Kerguelen Plateau using Ecopath with Ecosim to explore likely drivers of change in this relatively data-poor region. The Kerguelen Plateau is located at the centre of intersecting frontal systems and is inhabited by one of the largest populations of the commercially important Patagonian toothfish. We used this model to evaluate the environmental and human drivers of food web dynamics in the region by calibrating it with French and Australian fisheries data from 1997–2018 and biomass data for the period 1986–2018. Fishing was not identified as a driver of food web dynamics within this model, which could indicate that current management strategies are sustainable. A correlation analysis with environmental parameters likely to drive food web dynamics (sea surface temperature, zonal wind, Southern Annular Mode and chlorophyll a concentration) highlighted cool sea surface temperature, higher zonal wind speeds and negative phases of the Southern Annular Mode as important drivers of change, particularly during the summer. As the Southern Ocean is predicted to warm and winds are expected to intensify under future climate change, our study illustrates the importance of considering environmental change in ecosystem management.},

Yet, the focus on recovery to equilibrium has prevented us from assessing species responses to perturbations when abundances fluctuate over time. Here, we introduce two data-driven approaches (expected sensitivity and eigenvector rankings) based on the time-varying Jacobian matrix to rank species over time according to their sensitivity to perturbations on abundances. Using several population dynamics models, we demonstrate that we can infer these rankings from time-series data to predict the order of species sensitivities. We find that the most sensitive species are not always the ones with the most rapidly changing or lowest abundance, which are typical criteria used to monitor populations. Finally, using two empirical time series, we show that sensitive species tend to be harder to forecast. Our results suggest that incorporating information on species interactions can improve how we manage communities out of equilibrium.},

The matching between observed trophic and dynamic interactions provides evidence that population dynamic interactions reflect resource–consumer interactions in the many-species community. However, the presence of a trophic interaction does not always correspond to a detectable dynamic interaction especially for top-down effects. Moreover a considerable proportion of dynamic interactions are not attributable to direct trophic interactions, suggesting the unignorable role of non-trophic and indirect interactions as co-drivers of community dynamics.},

Timeseries analysis indicated that fluctuations in control populations were non-linear, and non-linearity increased substantially in response to harvesting. Both harvesting and stochasticity induced population juvenescence, but harvesting did so via the depletion of adults, whereas stochasticity increased the abundance of juveniles. A fitted fisheries model indicated that harvesting shifted populations towards higher reproductive rates and larger-magnitude damped oscillations that amplify demographic noise.

Understanding these impacts is therefore essential for managing ecosystems and sustaining human well-being. Here, we conducted a global synthesis of terrestrial, marine, and freshwater studies to identify key gaps in our knowledge of climate change impacts on food webs and determine whether the areas currently studied are those most likely to be impacted by climate change. We found research suffers from a strong geographic bias, with only 3.5\% of studies occurring in the tropics. Importantly, the distribution of sites sampled under projected climate changes was biased—areas with decreases or large increases in precipitation and areas with low magnitudes of temperature change were under-represented. Our results suggest that understanding of climate change impacts on food webs could be broadened by considering more than two trophic levels, responses in addition to species abundance and biomass, impacts of a wider suite of climatic variables, and tropical ecosystems. Most importantly, to enable better forecasts of biodiversity responses to climate change, we identify critically under-represented geographic regions and climatic conditions which should be prioritized in future research.},

Here we document how warming lake temperatures by up to 2°C, rather than changes in trophic state or fishing effort, have restructured the pelagic food web of a large European lake (Lake Maggiore, Italy). Our approach exploited abundance and biomass data collected weekly to yearly across five trophic levels from 1981 to 2008. Temperature generally had stronger effects on taxa than changes in fish predation or trophic state mediated through primary productivity. Consequently, we found that, as the lake warmed, the food web shifted in numerical abundance towards predators occupying middle trophic positions. Of these taxa, the spiny water flea (Bythotrephes longimanus) most prospered. Bythotrephes strongly limited abundances of the keystone grazer Daphnia, strengthening top-down structuring of the food web. Warmer temperatures partly restructured the food web by advancing peak Bythotrephes densities by approximately 60 days and extending periods of positive population growth by three times. Nonetheless, our results suggested that advances in the timing and size of peak Bythotrephes densities could not outpace changes in the timing and size of peak densities in their Daphnia prey. Our results provide rare evidence from nature as to how long-term warming can favour higher trophic levels, with the potential to strengthen top-down control of food webs.},

The theoretical background for these indicators is rich, but real-world tests are rare, especially for whole ecosystems. We tested the hypothesis that these statistics would be early warning signals for an experimentally induced regime shift in an aquatic food web. We gradually added top predators to a lake over 3 years to destabilize its food web. An adjacent lake was monitored simultaneously as a reference ecosystem. Warning signals of a regime shift were evident in the manipulated lake during reorganization of the food web more than a year before the food web transition was complete, corroborating theory for leading indicators of ecological regime shifts.},

	abstract = {The Northwest Atlantic cod stocks collapsed in the early 1990s and have yet to recover, despite the subsequent establishment of a continuing fishing moratorium. Efforts to understand the collapse and lack of recovery have so far focused mainly on the dynamics of commercially harvested species. Here, we use data from a 33-year scientific trawl survey to determine to which degree the signatures of the collapse and recovery of the cod are apparent in the spatial and temporal dynamics of the broader groundfish community. Over this 33-year period, the groundfish community experienced four phases of change: (i) a period of rapid, synchronous biomass collapse in most species, (ii) followed by a regime shift in community composition with a concomitant loss of functional diversity, (iii) followed in turn by periods of slow compositional recovery, and (iv) slow biomass growth. Our results demonstrate how a community-wide perspective can reveal new aspects of the dynamics of collapse and recovery unavailable from the analysis of individual species or a combination of a small number of species. Overall, we found evidence that such community-level signals should be useful for designing more effective management strategies to ensure the persistence of exploited marine ecosystems.},

Frank et al. report on the nature of the collapse and the reasons for its persistence. They find that the prolonged duration of the alternate (collapsed) state of the ecosystem was governed by the oscillatory, runaway consumption dynamics of the predator's former prey — forage fish. These prey species are now in decline, however, having outstripped their zooplankton food supply. The trend now is towards an increase in large-bodied zooplankton abundance, so a gradual return to the earlier ecosystem state is possible — a conclusion that bodes well for other collapsed fisheries.},

The adopted migrant hypothesis proposes a life history in which social learning transmits migratory knowledge between generations of iteroparous fish. Specifically, juveniles disperse from the parental spawning site, encounter and recruit to a local adult population, and learn migration routes between spawning and foraging habitats by following older, experienced fish. Although the adopted migrant life history may apply to many species of pelagic marine fishes, there is scant theoretical or empirical work on the consequent population dynamics. We developed and analyzed a mathematical model of this life history in which the recruitment of juveniles depends on the relative abundance of the local populations and recruitment overlap, which measures the ease with which juveniles are recruited by a nonparental population. We demonstrate that the adopted migrant life history can maintain spatial demographic structure among local populations, that it can also predispose local populations to collapse when a tipping point is crossed, and that recovery after collapse is impaired by reduced recruitment at small local population sizes.},

Here, we relate trends in species richness and abundance from 21,500 terrestrial and marine assemblage time series across temperate regions (23.5–60.0° latitude) to changes in air or sea surface temperature. We find a strong coupling between biodiversity and temperature changes in the marine realm, where species richness mostly increases with warming. However, biodiversity responses are conditional on the baseline climate, such that in initially warmer locations richness increase is more pronounced while abundance declines with warming. In contrast, we do not detect systematic temperature-related richness or abundance trends on land, despite a greater magnitude of warming. As the world is committed to further warming, substantial challenges remain in maintaining local biodiversity amongst the non-uniform inflow and outflow of ‘climate migrants’. Temperature-driven community restructuring is especially evident in the ocean, whereas climatic debt may be accumulating on land.},

Rapid compositional change is prevalent, with marine biomes exceeding and terrestrial biomes trailing the overall trend.

	abstract = {Natural ecosystems are often complex, dynamic and state-dependent (i.e., nonlinear), and it is difficult to forecast their (near) future states if we rely only on linear statistical approaches. In the past few decades, tools of nonlinear time series analysis have been developed to analyze and forecast the state-dependent behavior of nonlinear systems. These methods do not assume any set of equations governing the system, and thus are suitable for analyzing systems which are complex and for which it is therefore often difficult to make reasonable assumptions about their underlying mechanisms. Instead of assuming equations, these methods recover the dynamics (and potentially, their underlying mechanism) directly from time series data, and are thus called Empirical Dynamic Modeling (EDM). In this chapter, we will introduce a basic concept in EDM (i.e., state space reconstruction) and explain practical and detailed algorithms of two core EDM tools (i.e., simplex projection and S-map) to forecast ecological time series. Then, we show applications of this algorithm to community ecology and its potential to answer ecological questions.},

Warmer temperatures were associated with lower structural and temporal stability, while biodiversity had no consistent effects on either stability property. While species richness was associated with lower structural stability and higher temporal stability, Simpson diversity was associated with higher temporal stability. The responses of structural stability were linked to disproportionate contributions from two trophic groups (predators and consumers), while the responses of temporal stability were linked both to synchrony of all species within the food web and distinctive contributions from three trophic groups (predators, consumers, and producers). Our results suggest that, in natural ecosystems, warmer temperatures can erode ecosystem stability, while biodiversity changes may not have consistent effects.},

However, evidence from high-diversity ecological communities is lacking because of practical challenges in characterizing speciose communities and their interactions. Here, I analysed time-varying interaction networks that were reconstructed using 1197 species, DNA-based ecological time series taken from experimental rice plots and empirical dynamic modelling, and introduced ‘interaction capacity', namely, the sum of interaction strength that a single species gives and receives, as a potential driver of community diversity. As community diversity increases, the number of interactions increases exponentially but the mean interaction capacity of a community becomes saturated, weakening interspecific interactions. These patterns are modelled with simple mathematical equations, based on which I propose the ‘interaction capacity hypothesis': that interaction capacity and network connectance can be two fundamental properties that influence community diversity. Furthermore, I show that total DNA abundance and temperature influence interaction capacity and connectance nonlinearly, explaining a large proportion of diversity patterns observed in various systems. The interaction capacity hypothesis enables mechanistic explanations of community diversity. Therefore, analysing ecological community data from the viewpoint of interaction capacity would provide new insight into community diversity.},

	abstract = {The effects of temperature on interaction strengths are important for understanding and forecasting how global climate change impacts marine ecosystems; however, tracking and quantifying interactions of marine fish species are practically difficult especially under field conditions, and thus, how temperature influences their interaction strengths under field conditions remains poorly understood. We herein performed quantitative fish environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding on 550 seawater samples that were collected twice a month from 11 coastal sites for 2 years in the Boso Peninsula, Japan, and analyzed eDNA monitoring data using nonlinear time series analytical tools. We detected fish–fish interactions as information flow between eDNA time series, reconstructed interaction networks for the top 50 frequently detected species, and quantified pairwise, fluctuating interaction strengths. Although there was a large variation, water temperature influenced fish–fish interaction strengths. The impact of water temperature on interspecific interaction strengths varied among fish species, suggesting that fish species identity influences the temperature effects on interactions. For example, interaction strengths that Halichoeres tenuispinis and Microcanthus strigatus received strongly increased with water temperature, while those of Engraulis japonicus and Girella punctata decreased with water temperature. An increase in water temperature induced by global climate change may change fish interactions in a complex way, which consequently influences marine community dynamics and stability. Our research demonstrates a practical research framework to study the effects of environmental variables on interaction strengths of marine communities in nature, which would contribute to understanding and predicting natural marine ecosystem dynamics.},

	abstract = {Experiments have revealed much about top-down and bottom-up control in ecosystems, but manipulative experiments are limited in spatial and temporal scale. To obtain a more nuanced understanding of trophic control over large scales, we explored long-term time-series data from 13 globally distributed lakes and used empirical dynamic modelling to quantify interaction strengths between zooplankton and phytoplankton over time within and across lakes. Across all lakes, top-down effects were associated with nutrients, switching from negative in mesotrophic lakes to positive in oligotrophic lakes. This result suggests that zooplankton nutrient recycling exceeds grazing pressure in nutrient-limited systems. Within individual lakes, results were consistent with a ‘seasonal reset’ hypothesis in which top-down and bottom-up interactions varied seasonally and were both strongest at the beginning of the growing season. Thus, trophic control is not static, but varies with abiotic conditions – dynamics that only become evident when observing changes over large spatial and temporal scales.},

We show that complexity, in the form of multiple interacting components, can actually be an asset for studying natural systems from temporal data. The central idea is that multidimensional time series enable system dynamics to be reconstructed from multiple viewpoints, and these viewpoints can be combined into a single model. We show how our approach, multiview embedding (MVE), can improve forecasts for simulated ecosystems and a mesocosm experiment. By leveraging complexity, MVE is particularly effective for overcoming the limitations of short and noisy time series and should be highly relevant for many areas of science.},

	abstract = {It is well known that fluctuations of species abundances observed in ecological time series emerge from an interplay between deterministic nonlinear dynamics and stochastic forces. Importantly, nonlinearity and stochasticity introduce significant challenges to the analysis of ecological time series, such as the inference of the effect of species interactions on community dynamics and forecasting of species abundances. Local linear fits with state-space-dependent kernel functions, known as S-maps, provide an efficient method to infer Jacobian coefficients (a proxy for the local effect of species interactions) and to make reliable forecasts from nonlinear time series. Yet, while it has been shown that the S-map outperforms existing methods for nonparametric inference and forecasting, the methodology is sensitive to process noise. To overcome this limitation, we integrate the S-map with different regularization schemes. To validate our approach, we test our methodology against different levels of noise and nonlinearity using three standard population dynamics models. We show that an appropriate choice of the regularization scheme, alongside an accurate choice of the kernel functions, can significantly improve the in-sample inference of Jacobian coefficients and the out-of-sample forecast of species abundances in the presence of process noise. We further validate our methodology using two empirical time series of marine microbial communities. Our results illustrate that the regularized S-map is an efficient method for nonparametric inference and forecasting from noisy, nonlinear, ecological time series. Yet, attention must be paid on the regularization scheme and the structure of the kernel for whether inference or forecasting is the ultimate goal of a research study.},

Here, we clarify the correspondence and distinctions among the Interaction matrix, the Alpha matrix, and the Jacobian matrix, terms that are frequently used interchangeably as well as synonymously with the term “community matrix.” We illustrate how these matrices correspond to different ways of characterizing interaction strengths, how they permit insights regarding different types of press perturbations, and how these are related by a simple scaling relationship. Connections to additional interaction strength characterizations encapsulated by the Beta matrix, the Gamma matrix, and the Removal matrix are also discussed.

Determining the generality of this relationship, and discovering the mechanisms that underlie it, are vitally important for ecosystem management. Here, we investigate how species richness affects the temporal stability of biomass production by reanalyzing 27 recent biodiversity experiments conducted with primary producers. We find that, in grasslands, increasing species richness stabilizes whole-community biomass but destabilizes the dynamics of constituent populations. Community biomass is stabilized because species richness impacts mean biomass more strongly than its variance. In algal communities, species richness has a minimal effect on community stability because richness affects the mean and variance of biomass nearly equally. Using a new measure of synchrony among species, we find that for both grasslands and algae, temporal correlations in species biomass are lower when species are grown together in polyculture than when grown alone in monoculture. These results suggest that interspecific interactions tend to stabilize community biomass in diverse communities. Contrary to prevailing theory, we found no evidence that species’ responses to environmental variation in monoculture predicted the strength of diversity’s stabilizing effect. Together, these results deepen our understanding of when and why increasing species richness stabilizes community biomass.},

In this study, we investigated the ability of eRNA to detect changes in gene expression in Japanese medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) in response to sublethal pyrene exposure, as a model toxic chemical. We performed standardized acute toxicity tests and collected eRNA from tank water and RNA from fish tissue after 96 h of exposure. Our results showed that over 1000 genes were detected in eRNA and the sequenced read counts of these genes correlated with those in fish tissue (r = 0.50). Moreover, eRNA detected 86 differentially expressed genes in response to pyrene, some of which were shared by fish RNA, including the suppression of collagen fiber genes. These results suggest that eRNA has the potential to detect changes in gene expression in fish in response to environmental stressors without the need for sacrificing or causing pain to fish. However, we also found that the majority of sequenced reads of eRNA ({\textgreater}99\%) were not mapped to the reference medaka genome and they originated from bacteria and fungi, resulting in low sequencing depth. In addition, eRNA, in particular nuclear genes, was highly degraded with a median transcript integrity number (TIN) of {\textless}20. These limitations highlight the need for future studies to improve the analytical methods of eRNA application.},

By assembling published data from studies in exploited North Atlantic ecosystems, we found pronounced geographical variation in top-down and bottom-up trophic forcing. The data suggest that ecosystem susceptibility to top-down control and their resiliency to exploitation are related to species richness and oceanic temperature conditions.

The Scotian Shelf-Bay of Fundy herring fisheries (NAFO Division 4VWX) is among Canada's oldest and drives this productivity, accounting for up to 75\% of the total herring catch in some years. The stocks’ productivity and overall health have declined since 1965. Despite management measures to promote recovery implemented since 2003, biomass remains low and is declining. The factors that drive the productivity of 4VWX herring are primarily unresolved, likely impeding the effectiveness of management actions on this stock. We evaluated potential drivers of herring variability by analyzing 52 time-series that describe the temporal and spatial evolution of the 4VWX herring population and the physical, ecological, and anthropogenic factors that could affect them using structural equation models. Variation in herring biomass was best accounted for by the exploitation rate's negative effect and the geographic distribution of fishing and recruitment. Thermal phenology and temperature adversely and egg predation positively impacted the early life stage mortality rate and, ultimately, adult biomass. These findings are broadly relevant to fisheries management, but particularly for 4VWX herring, where the current management approach does not consider their early life stage dynamics or assess them within the ecosystem or climate change contexts.},

Both the prolonged lack of recovery and the recent improvement have been attributed to changes in the biomass of forage fishes through effects of predation and competition by these fishes on early life stages of cod. An examination of the relationships between forage fish biomass and the population dynamics of ESS cod provided no support for this hypothesis. Contrary to expectations under this hypothesis, cod recruitment rate was unrelated to forage fish biomass. The main factor delaying recovery was high natural mortality (M) of adult cod. The recent improvement in ESS cod is due to the strong 2004 year class and a decline in M. These factors cannot be attributed to an effect of forage fishes. Both the delay in recovery and recent improvement of the ESS cod stock appear to be due to factors other than interactions with forage fishes.},

In the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence (sGSL), the failed recovery is due to severe increases in the natural mortality of adult Atlantic cod. We examined the role of predation by grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) in this failed recovery by directly incorporating grey seal predation in the population model for Atlantic cod via a functional response. Estimated predation mortality of adult Atlantic cod increased sharply during the cod collapse and has continued to increase, comprising the majority of mortality since the late 1990s. While predation by grey seals appeared to play a minor role in the collapse of Atlantic cod, we found it to be the main factor preventing recovery. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that failed recovery is due to predation-driven Allee effects, a demographic effect due to the decline in cod abundance and an emergent effect resulting from increasing grey seal abundance. Under current conditions, extirpation of sGSL Atlantic cod appears likely unless there is a large decline in the abundance of grey seals.},

	abstract = {The great “northern” cod (Gadus morhua) stock, formerly among the world’s largest and the icon for depletion and supposed nonrecovery of marine fishes, is making a major comeback after nearly two decades of attrition and fishery moratorium. Using acoustic-trawl surveys of the main prespawning and spawning components of the stock, we show that biomass has increased from tens of thousands of tonnes to {\textgreater}200 thousand tonnes within the last decade. The increase was signalled by massive schooling behaviour in late winter first observed in 2008 in the southern range of the stock (Bonavista Corridor) after an absence for 15 years, perhaps spurred by immigration. Increases in size composition and fish condition and apparent declines in mortality followed, leading to growth rates approaching 30\% per annum. In the spring of 2015, large increases in cod abundance and size composition were observed for the first time since the moratorium in the more northerly spawning groups of this stock complex. The cod rebound has paralleled increases in the abundance of capelin (Mallotus villosus), whose abundance declined rapidly in the cold early 1990s but has recently increased during a period of warm ocean temperatures. With continued growth in the capelin stock and frugal management (low fishing mortality), this stock could rebuild, perhaps within less than a decade, to historical levels of sustainable yield. More generally, if this stock can recover, the potential exists for recovery of many other depleted stocks worldwide.},

	abstract = {A debate has developed over the ecosystem consequences following the collapse of Atlantic cod throughout the coastal waters of eastern Canada. The explosive increase in pelagic fish abundance in scientific bottom-trawl catches on the eastern Scotian Shelf has been interpreted as being due to either (i) a “pelagic outburst” of forage fish abundance resulting from predator release or conversely (ii) a change in pelagic fish vertical distribution leading to a “suprabenthic habitat occupation” thereby increasing their availability to bottom trawls. These two interpretations have diametrically opposing ecological consequences and suggest different management strategies for these important forage fish species. We argue that an objective evaluation of the available evidence supports the hypothesis that the abundance of forage fish has not increased in response to the demise of cod and other top predators, and the reliance on a single sampling gear with low catchability has biased and will continue to bias the interpretation of demographic trends of pelagic fish populations. We advocate that multiple sampling technologies providing alternative perspectives are needed for the monitoring and management of the various trophic levels if we are to achieve a balanced and objective understanding of marine ecosystems.},

The prevailing assumption is that this large-scale coherent variability is a response to coupled atmosphere–ocean dynamics, commonly represented by climate indexes, such as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and North Atlantic Oscillation. On the other hand, it has been suggested that exploitation might contribute to this coherent variability. This possibility has been generally ignored or dismissed on the grounds that exploitation is unlikely to operate synchronously at such large spatial scales. Our analysis of adult fishing mortality and spawning stock biomass of 22 North Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) stocks revealed that both the temporal and spatial scales in fishing mortality and spawning stock biomass were equivalent to those of the climate drivers. From these results, we conclude that greater consideration must be given to the potential of exploitation as a driving force behind broad, coherent variability of heavily exploited fish species.},

We examined time series of intensive empirical observations from nine heavily exploited regions in the western North Atlantic and find evidence of spatial variance of trophic control. Top-down control dominated in northern areas, the dynamics evolved from bottom-up to top-down in an intermediate region, and bottom-up control governed the southern areas. A simplified, trophic control diagram was developed accounting for top-down and bottom-up forcing within a larger region whose base state dynamics are bottom-up and can accommodate time-varying dynamics. Species diversity and ocean temperature co-varied, being relatively high in southern areas and lower in the north, mirroring the shifting pattern of trophic control. A combination of compensatory population dynamics and accelerated demographic rates in southern areas seems to account for the greater stability of the predator species complex in this region.},

(Nature, 477, 2011, 86) hypothesize that the slow recovery of the Scotian Shelf ecosystem to its structure prior to the early 1990s is a result of the oscillatory, runaway consumption dynamics of the forage fish complex. Their hypothesis is based on the underlying assumptions that this ecosystem's dynamics are governed by top-down forcing, predator–prey role reversals, and a trophic cascade extending from demersal predatory fish, especially cod, down to the level of nutrients (Science, 308, 2005, 1621; Nature, 477, 2011, 86). Greene and Pershing (Science, 315, 2007, 1084) called into question the underlying assumption of an extended trophic cascade. They argued that while top-down forcing can be important at higher trophic levels in many Northwest Atlantic Shelf ecosystems, its impacts on zooplankton, phytoplankton, and nutrients are minor or nonexistent. Instead, they argued that lower trophic-level dynamics in these ecosystems are governed by climate-associated, bottom-up forcing. Observations over the past three decades (Greene et al. Ecology, 89, (Suppl 11), 2008, S24; MERCINA Oceanography, 25, 2012, 208.) are consistent with predictions from the climate-forcing hypothesis proposed by Greene and Pershing (Science, 315, 2007, 1084), while those from the past decade (MERCINA, Oceanography, 25, 2012, 208) demonstrate that the trophic cascade hypothesis as proposed by Frank et al. (Science, 308, 2005, 1621) should be rejected. A closer examination of these observations also calls into question the hypothesis of ecosystem recovery in the Northwest Atlantic being governed by the oscillatory, runaway consumption dynamics of the forage fish complex.},

	abstract = {Virtually all studies reporting deepening with increasing size or age by fishes involve commercially harvested species. Studies of North Sea plaice in the early 1900s first documented this phenomenon (named Heincke’s law); it occurred at a time of intensive harvesting and rapid technological changes in fishing methods. The possibility that this deepening might be the result of harvesting has never been evaluated. Instead, age- or size-related deepening have been credited to interactions between density-dependent food resources and density-independent environmental factors. Recently, time-dependent depth variations have been ascribed to ocean warming. We use a model, initialized from observations of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) on the eastern Scotian Shelf, where an age-dependent deepening of ∼60 m was observed, to assess the effect of size- and depth-selective exploitation on fish distribution. Exploitation restricted to the upper 80 m can account for ∼72\% of the observed deepening; by extending exploitation to 120 m, all of the deepening can be accounted for. In the absence of fishing, the model indicated no age-related deepening. Observations of depth distributions of older cod during a moratorium on fishing supported this prediction; however, younger cod exhibited low-amplitude deepening (10–15 m) suggestive of an ontogenetic response. The implications of these findings are manifold, particularly as they relate to hypotheses advanced to explain the ecological and evolutionary basis for ontogenetic deepening and to recent calls for the adoption of evidence of species deepening as a biotic indicator or “footprint” of warming seas.},

Although periodic declines in various important commercial fish stocks have been observed in this ecosystem, the most drastic changes took place in the early 1990s when the ecosystem structure changed abruptly and has not returned to its previous configuration. In the Northwest Atlantic, food web dynamics are determined largely by capelin (Mallotus villosus), the focal forage species which links primary and secondary producers with the higher trophic levels. Notwithstanding the importance of capelin, the factors that influence its population dynamics have remained elusive. We found that a regime shift and ocean climate, acting via food availability, have discernible impacts on the regulation of this population. Capelin biomass and timing of spawning were well explained by a regime shift and seasonal sea ice dynamics, a key determinant of the pelagic spring bloom. Our findings are important for the development of ecosystem approaches to fisheries management and raise questions on the potential impacts of climate change on the structure and productivity of this marine ecosystem.},

Fisheries and Oceans Canada determined that the Newfoundland capelin stock (Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization Divisions 2J3KL) suffered an order of magnitude decline in biomass in 1990-1991. This collapse was concomitant with drastic changes observed in the ecosystem during the late 1980s and early 1990s. While the results of more than a dozen studies have supported the capelin stock collapse hypothesis, an alternative non-collapse hypothesis proposed that rather than collapsing in 1990-1991, the capelin stock either (1) changed its migratory patterns while the timing of the spring capelin acoustic survey remained constant, leading to a spatio-temporal mismatch between the spring acoustic survey and the stock, or (2) became less migratory and remained inshore year-round, therefore being largely underestimated by the offshore spring and fall acoustic surveys. The collapse and non-collapse hypotheses were tested using multiple independent data sets, which included both fishery-dependent (inshore commercial catch) and fishery-independent (spring and fall acoustic and fall bottom-trawl surveys, capelin larval indices, aerial surveys, predator diet and behavior) data, and diverse statistical methods. The weight of evidence approach led us to reject the non-collapse hypothesis and conclude that the Newfoundland capelin stock did collapse in 1990-1991 with minimal recovery over the subsequent 3 decades.},

Explosive increases in the abundance of their pelagic fish and invertebrate prey (notably capelin, sand lance, herring, shrimp and snow crab) generally followed. However, several investigators have concluded, based on the results of annual acoustic surveys, that the lightly exploited capelin stock in the Newfoundland/Labrador (NL) region experienced a sudden 6.8 Mt (98\%) decline in biomass from 1990 to 1991 coincident with the groundfish collapse. Given the enormity, duration and unexpected nature of this decline, it was characterized as a collapse. The contrasting response of this capelin stock to the groundfish collapse relative to other North Atlantic (NA) ecosystems prompted us to undertake systematic analyses of the NL ecosystem. The reported capelin collapse in NL should have induced significant responses of trophically linked species, as have been reported in other NA ecosystems. We found little evidence of changes in the population abundance, diet and condition of marine mammals, cod, seabirds and zooplankton, in indexes of the areal occupancy and spawning biomass of capelin, or of environmental effects. These results strongly support the hypothesis that the reported collapse did not occur. Profound seasonal distribution changes, a fixed in time and space acoustic survey in a restricted portion of the distributional range of capelin, and the possibility that NL capelin stock has become less migratory provide a more robust and consistent explanation of the observations.},

There is limited support for the fishery-induced trophic cascade hypothesis. The predictions of the climate variability hypothesis are generally met for the lower and middle trophic levels, but the ongoing high levels of natural mortality of groundfish are not accounted for. We propose an alternative hypothesis encompassing concurrent top-down and bottom-up processes, and conclude that many species of groundfish (including cod) and small pelagic fish stocks (including herring) will not recover with the ongoing high levels of natural mortality generated by grey seal predation.

	abstract = {The impacts of climate change are widespread and threaten natural systems globally. Yet, within regions, heterogeneous physical landscapes can differentially filter climate, leading to local response diversity. For example, it is possible that while freshwater lakes are sensitive to climate change, they may exhibit a diversity of thermal responses owing to their unique morphology, which in turn can differentially affect the growth and survival of vulnerable biota such as fishes. In particular, salmonids are cold-water fishes with complex life histories shaped by diverse freshwater habitats that are sensitive to warming temperatures. Here we examine the influence of habitat on the growth of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) in nursery lakes of Canada's Skeena River watershed over a century of change in regional temperature and intraspecific competition. We found that freshwater growth has generally increased over the last century. While growth tended to be higher in years with relatively higher summer air temperatures (a proxy for lake temperature), long-term increases in growth appear largely influenced by reduced competition. However, habitat played an important role in modulating the effect of high temperature. Specifically, growth was positively associated with rising temperatures in relatively deep ({\textgreater}50 m) nursery lakes, whereas warmer temperatures were not associated with a change in growth for fish among shallow lakes. The influence of temperature on growth also was modulated by glacier extent whereby the growth of fish from lakes situated in watersheds with little (i.e., {\textless}5\%) glacier cover increased with rising temperatures, but decreased with rising temperatures for fish in lakes within more glaciated watersheds. Maintaining the integrity of an array of freshwater habitats—and the processes that generate and maintain them—will help foster a diverse climate-response portfolio for important fish species, which in turn can ensure that salmon watersheds are resilient to future environmental change.},

The objective of this study was to identify which pressures are most directly related to changes in the fish community of the Grand Bank, Northwest Atlantic. These changes are characterized by a collapse and partial recovery of fish biomass and shifting trophic structure over the past three decades. All possible subsets of nine fishing and environmental pressure indicators were evaluated as predictors of the fish community structure (represented by the biomasses of six fish functional-feeding groups), for periods Before (1985–1995) and After (1996–2013) the collapse, and the Full time series. We modeled these relationships using redundancy analysis, an extension of multiple linear regression that simultaneously evaluates the effect of one or more predictors on several response variables. The analysis was repeated with different lengths (0–5 years) and types (moving average vs. lags) of time delays imposed on the predictors. Both fishing and environmental indicators were included in the best models for all types and length of time delays, reinforcing that there is no single type of pressure impacting the fish community in this region. Results show notable differences in the most influential pressures Before and After the collapse, which reflects the changes in harvester behavior in response to the groundfish moratoria in the mid-1990s. The best models for Before the collapse had strikingly high explanatory power when compared to the other periods, which we speculate is because of changes in the relationships among and within the pressures and responses. Moving average predictor sets generally had higher explanatory power than lagged sets, implying that trends in pressures are important for predicting changes in the fish community. Assigning a carefully chosen delay to each predictor further improved the explanatory power, which is indicative of the complexity of interactions between pressures and responses. Here we add to the current understanding of this ecosystem, while demonstrating a method for selecting pressures that could be useful to scientists and managers in other ecosystems.},

	abstract = {The stock–recruitment relationship is the basis of any stock prediction and thus fundamental for fishery management. Traditional parametric stock–recruitment models often poorly fit empirical data, nevertheless they are still the rule in fish stock assessment procedures. We here apply a multi-model approach to predict recruitment of 20 Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) stocks as a function of adult biomass and environmental variables. We compare the traditional Ricker model with two non-parametric approaches: (i) the stochastic cusp model from catastrophe theory and (ii) multivariate simplex projections, based on attractor state-space reconstruction. We show that the performance of each model is contingent on the historical dynamics of individual stocks, and that stocks which experienced abrupt and state-dependent dynamics are best modelled using non-parametric approaches. These dynamics are pervasive in Western stocks highlighting a geographical distinction between cod stocks, which have implications for their recovery potential. Furthermore, the addition of environmental variables always improved the models’ predictive power indicating that they should be considered in stock assessment and management routines. Using our multi-model approach, we demonstrate that we should be more flexible when modelling recruitment and tailor our approaches to the dynamical properties of each individual stock.},

	abstract = {Understanding large-scale phytoplankton dynamics requires accurate, multi-decadal measurements of abundance and distribution. Since 1890, marine phytoplankton abundance has been assessed using a diverse range of sensors and observational platforms, and inter-calibrating these data have been challenging. Consequently, syntheses of historical phytoplankton data have been rarely attempted, and the need for accurate, long-term assessments of phytoplankton abundance and distribution is commonly acknowledged. Here, we derive quantitative indices of phytoplankton abundance from measurements of upper ocean transparency and color-calibrated with direct measurements of surface chlorophyll. The strong correlation and linear scaling of the predicted data enabled the construction of a comprehensive, globally intercalibrated chlorophyll time series from 1890 to 2010. The calibrated chlorophyll data reproduced the well-established spatial features of phytoplankton surface biomass and were strongly correlated with chlorophyll concentration derived from two independent remote sensing platforms discontinuously available since 1978. These results suggest that with careful statistical treatment it is possible to generate a globally integrated chlorophyll time series extending 120 years into the past. This database, which is available in the web appendices of this paper, may enable new insights in the areas of climate science, biogeochemical cycling, and marine ecosystem structure and functioning over the past century.},

	abstract = {The stocks of Atlantic cod Gadus morhua in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean declined in abundance from 1965 to 2003; the declines in spawning stock biomass (SSB) have been temporally coherent. A coherent, sharp increase in SSBs from 1975 to 1985 and a subsequent decrease from 1985 to 1992 are superimposed on the general decline. The coherence suggests that cod stock variability in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean is driven by a common set of causes or that the linkages among the nominal stocks are stronger than was previously thought. The coherent increases in cod SSB from the mid-1970s to 1985 occurred under relatively low fishing mortalities. The declines in SSB beginning in 1985 began during a period of low fishing mortalities. During the 1985-1992 period the declines in Atlantic cod abundance were coupled with greatly reduced growth rates, increased natural mortality rates, and a lack of response to reduced fishing mortality. This suggests that the 1985-1992 decreases were driven by a strong negative environmental signal, implying that the environment had a stronger role in affecting cod abundance than had been previously thought. It appears that the decline in SSB over most of the range of the cod was coupled with a major perturbation in the forage available to cod. Inasmuch as this perturbation involved seemingly disparate groups, such as capelin Mallotus villosus, euphausids, and Atlantic herring Clupea harengus, it appears that the change in the environment was associated with the dynamics of the plankton.},

Over the past decade, sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Maine increased faster than 99\% of the global ocean. The warming, which was related to a northward shift in the Gulf Stream and to changes in the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation, led to reduced recruitment and increased mortality in the region’s Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) stock. Failure to recognize the impact of warming on cod contributed to overfishing. Recovery of this fishery depends on sound management, but the size of the stock depends on future temperature conditions.

To facilitate new analyses, we developed a new database, the RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database, for commercially exploited marine fishes and invertebrates. Time series of total biomass, spawner biomass, recruits, fishing mortality and catch/landings form the core of the database. Assessments were assembled from 21 national and international management agencies for a total of 331 stocks (295 fish stocks representing 46 families and 36 invertebrate stocks representing 12 families), including nine of the world’s 10 largest fisheries. Stock assessments were available from 27 large marine ecosystems, the Caspian Sea and four High Seas regions, and include the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, Arctic and Antarctic Oceans. Most assessments came from the USA, Europe, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. Assessed marine stocks represent a small proportion of harvested fish taxa (16\%), and an even smaller proportion of marine fish biodiversity (1\%), but provide high-quality data for intensively studied stocks. The database provides new insight into the status of exploited populations: 58\% of stocks with reference points (n = 214) were estimated to be below the biomass resulting in maximum sustainable yield (BMSY) and 30\% had exploitation levels above the exploitation rate resulting in maximum sustainable yield (UMSY). We anticipate that the database will facilitate new research in population dynamics and fishery management, and we encourage further data contributions from stock assessment scientists.},

For each fishery, we estimate current biological status and forecast the impacts of contrasting management regimes on catch, profit, and biomass of fish in the sea. We estimate unique recovery targets and trajectories for each fishery, calculate the year-by-year effects of alternative recovery approaches, and model how alternative institutional reforms affect recovery outcomes. Current status is highly heterogeneous—the median fishery is in poor health (overfished, with further overfishing occurring), although 32\% of fisheries are in good biological, although not necessarily economic, condition. Our business-as-usual scenario projects further divergence and continued collapse for many of the world’s fisheries. Applying sound management reforms to global fisheries in our dataset could generate annual increases exceeding 16 million metric tons (MMT) in catch, \$53 billion in profit, and 619 MMT in biomass relative to business as usual. We also find that, with appropriate reforms, recovery can happen quickly, with the median fishery taking under 10 y to reach recovery targets. Our results show that commonsense reforms to fishery management would dramatically improve overall fish abundance while increasing food security and profits.},

Land-based expansion is possible but may exacerbate climate change and biodiversity loss, and compromise the delivery of other ecosystem services2–6. As food from the sea represents only 17\% of the current production of edible meat, we ask how much food we can expect the ocean to sustainably produce by 2050. Here we examine the main food-producing sectors in the ocean—wild fisheries, finfish mariculture and bivalve mariculture—to estimate ‘sustainable supply curves’ that account for ecological, economic, regulatory and technological constraints. We overlay these supply curves with demand scenarios to estimate future seafood production. We find that under our estimated demand shifts and supply scenarios (which account for policy reform and technology improvements), edible food from the sea could increase by 21–44 million tonnes by 2050, a 36–74\% increase compared to current yields. This represents 12–25\% of the estimated increase in all meat needed to feed 9.8 billion people by 2050. Increases in all three sectors are likely, but are most pronounced for mariculture. Whether these production potentials are realized sustainably will depend on factors such as policy reforms, technological innovation and the extent of future shifts in demand.},

Although the data are collected in a scientifically and statistically appropriate context and represent an important source of fishery-independent information for agency-specific stock assessments, their use and dissemination has often been limited to the agencies conducting the surveys. In recent years, Internet data portals such as the Ocean Biogeographic Information System have provided an arena for the wider distribution and use of marine fish data. Despite the increased accessibility of such data, their scientific acceptability has been limited by a lack of reproducibility in data analyses. We present a methodology for the computation of time-series of groundfish stock indices using publicly available trawl survey data derived from the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans Maritimes region. Potential pitfalls associated with the computation of time-series are discussed and proper stratified random estimates of temporal abundance trends are compared with other methods for a selected subset of species. Also, the broader applicability of the methods for datasets collected under similar sampling designs is discussed, along with the reproducibility of the analyses and results.},

Here we present a practical method, using available time-series data, to measure and forecast changing interactions in real systems, and identify the underlying mechanisms. The method is illustrated with model data from a marine mesocosm experiment and limnologic field data from Sparkling Lake, WI, USA. From simple to complex, these examples demonstrate the feasibility of quantifying, predicting and understanding state-dependent, nonlinear interactions as they occur in situ and in real time—a requirement for managing resources in a nonlinear, non-equilibrium world.},

Larger-bodied predators appear to induce stronger trophic cascades (a greater rebound of resource density toward carrying capacity), but how this happens is unknown because we lack a clear depiction of how the strength of trophic cascades is determined. Using consumer resource models, we first show that the strength of a trophic cascade has an upper limit set by the interaction strength between the basal trophic group and its consumer and that this limit is approached as the interaction strength between the consumer and its predator increases. We then express the strength of a trophic cascade explicitly in terms of predator body size and use two independent parameter sets to calculate how the strength of a trophic cascade depends on predator size. Both parameter sets predict a positive effect of predator size on the strength of a trophic cascade, driven mostly by the body size dependence of the interaction strength between the first two trophic levels. Our results support previous empirical findings and suggest that the loss of larger predators will have greater consequences on trophic control and biomass structure in food webs than the loss of smaller predators.},

	abstract = {Human impacts are dramatically altering our natural ecosystems but the exact repercussions on ecological sustainability and function remain unclear. As a result, food web theory has experienced a proliferation of research seeking to address these critical areas. Arguing that the various recent and classical food web theories can be looked at collectively and in a highly consistent and testable way, Food Webs synthesizes and reconciles modern and classical perspectives into a general unified theory. Kevin McCann brings together outcomes from population-, community-, and ecosystem-level approaches under the common currency of energy or material fluxes. He shows that these approaches--often studied in isolation--all have the same general implications in terms of population dynamic stability. Specifically, increased fluxes of energy or material tend to destabilize populations, communities, and whole ecosystems. With this understanding, stabilizing structures at different levels of the ecological hierarchy can be identified and any population-, community-, or ecosystem-level structures that mute energy or material flow also stabilize systems dynamics. McCann uses this powerful general framework to discuss the effects of human impact on the stability and sustainability of ecological systems, and he demonstrates that there is clear empirical evidence that the structures supporting ecological systems have been dangerously eroded. Uniting the latest research on food webs with classical theories, this book will be a standard source in the understanding of natural food web functions.},

Although the data are collected in a scientifically and statistically appropriate context and represent an important source of fishery-independent information for agency-specific stock assessments, their use and dissemination has often been limited to the agencies conducting the surveys. In recent years, Internet data portals such as the Ocean Biogeographic Information System have provided an arena for the wider distribution and use of marine fish data. Despite the increased accessibility of such data, their scientific acceptability has been limited by a lack of reproducibility in data analyses. We present a methodology for the computation of time-series of groundfish stock indices using publicly available trawl survey data derived from the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans Maritimes region. Potential pitfalls associated with the computation of time-series are discussed and proper stratified random estimates of temporal abundance trends are compared with other methods for a selected subset of species. Also, the broader applicability of the methods for datasets collected under similar sampling designs is discussed, along with the reproducibility of the analyses and results.},

	abstract = {Traits underlie organismal responses to their environment and are essential to predict community responses to environmental conditions under global change. Species differ in life-history traits, morphometrics, diet type, reproductive characteristics and habitat utilization. Trait associations are widely analysed using phylogenetic comparative methods (PCM) to account for correlations among related species. Similarly, traits are measured for some but not all species, and missing continuous traits (e.g. growth rate) can be imputed using ‘phylogenetic trait imputation’ (PTI), based on evolutionary relatedness and trait covariance. However, PTI has not been available for categorical traits, and estimating covariance among traits without ecological constraints risks inferring implausible evolutionary mechanisms. Here, we extend previous PCM and PTI methods by (1) specifying covariance among traits as a structural equation model (SEM), and (2) incorporating associations among both continuous and categorical traits. Fitting a SEM replaces the covariance among traits with a set of linear path coefficients specifying potential evolutionary mechanisms. Estimated parameters then represent regression slopes (i.e. the average change in trait Y given an exogenous change in trait X) that can be used to calculate both direct effects (X impacts Y) and indirect effects (X impacts Z and Z impacts Y). We demonstrate phylogenetic structural-equation mixed-trait imputation using 33 variables representing life history, reproductive, morphological, and behavioural traits for all {\textgreater}32,000 described fishes worldwide. SEM coefficients suggest that one degree Celsius increase in habitat is associated with an average 3.5\% increase in natural mortality (including a 1.4\% indirect impact that acts via temperature effects on the growth coefficient), and an average 3.0\% decrease in fecundity (via indirect impacts on maximum age and length). Cross-validation indicates that the model explains 54\%–89\% of variance for withheld measurements of continuous traits and has an area under the receiver-operator-characteristics curve of 0.86–0.99 for categorical traits. We use imputed traits to classify all fishes into life-history types, and confirm a phylogenetic signal in three dominant life-history strategies in fishes. PTI using phylogenetic SEMs ensures that estimated parameters are interpretable as regression slopes, such that the inferred evolutionary relationships can be compared with long-term evolutionary and rearing experiments.},

	abstract = {Fisheries scientists use biological models to determine sustainable fishing rates and forecast future dynamics. These models require both life-history parameters (mortality, maturity, growth) and stock-recruit parameters (juvenile production). However, there has been little research to simultaneously predict life-history and stock-recruit parameters. I develop the first data-integrated life-history model, which extends a simple model of evolutionary dynamics to field measurements of life-history parameters as well as historical records of spawning output and subsequent recruitment. This evolutionary model predicts recruitment productivity (steepness) and variability (variance and autocorrelation in recruitment deviations) as well as mortality, maturity, growth, and size, and uses these to predict intrinsic growth rate (r) for all described fishes. The model confirms previous analysis showing little correlation between steepness and either natural mortality or asymptotic maximum size (). However, it does reveal taxonomic patterns, where family Sebastidae has lower steepness () and Salmonidae has elevated steepness () relative to the prediction for bony fishes (class Actinopterygii, ). Similarly, genus Sebastes has growth rate (0.09) approaching that of several shark families (Lamniformes: 0.02; Carcharhiniformes: 0.02). A cross-validation experiment confirms that the model is accurate, explains a substantial portion of variance (32\%–67\%), but generates standard errors that are somewhat too small. Predictive intervals are tighter for species than for higher-level organizations (e.g. families), and predictions (including intervals) are available for all fishes worldwide in R package FishLife. I conclude by outlining how multivariate predictions of life-history and stock-recruit parameters could be useful for stock assessment, decision theory, ensemble modelling and strategic management.},

Whilst LMMs offer a flexible approach to modelling a broad range of data types, ecological data are often complex and require complex model structures, and the fitting and interpretation of such models is not always straightforward. The ability to achieve robust biological inference requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here, we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding. This overview should serve as a widely accessible code of best practice for applying LMMs to complex biological problems and model structures, and in doing so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn from studies investigating ecological and evolutionary questions.},

	abstract = {Linear mixed-effects models are powerful tools for analysing complex datasets with repeated or clustered observations, a common data structure in ecology and evolution. Mixed-effects models involve complex fitting procedures and make several assumptions, in particular about the distribution of residual and random effects. Violations of these assumptions are common in real datasets, yet it is not always clear how much these violations matter to accurate and unbiased estimation. Here we address the consequences of violations in distributional assumptions and the impact of missing random effect components on model estimates. In particular, we evaluate the effects of skewed, bimodal and heteroscedastic random effect and residual variances, of missing random effect terms and of correlated fixed effect predictors. We focus on bias and prediction error on estimates of fixed and random effects. Model estimates were usually robust to violations of assumptions, with the exception of slight upward biases in estimates of random effect variance if the generating distribution was bimodal but was modelled by Gaussian error distributions. Further, estimates for (random effect) components that violated distributional assumptions became less precise but remained unbiased. However, this particular problem did not affect other parameters of the model. The same pattern was found for strongly correlated fixed effects, which led to imprecise, but unbiased estimates, with uncertainty estimates reflecting imprecision. Unmodelled sources of random effect variance had predictable effects on variance component estimates. The pattern is best viewed as a cascade of hierarchical grouping factors. Variances trickle down the hierarchy such that missing higher-level random effect variances pool at lower levels and missing lower-level and crossed random effect variances manifest as residual variance. Overall, our results show remarkable robustness of mixed-effects models that should allow researchers to use mixed-effects models even if the distributional assumptions are objectively violated. However, this does not free researchers from careful evaluation of the model. Estimates that are based on data that show clear violations of key assumptions should be treated with caution because individual datasets might give highly imprecise estimates, even if they will be unbiased on average across datasets.},

	abstract = {The Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) stocks in the Newfoundland-Labrador Shelves (NL) and Barents Sea (BS) ecosystems have shown divergent trajectories over the last 40 years. Both stocks experienced either an important decline (BS) or a collapse (NL) in the mid-1980s and early 1990s, respectively. After these population reductions, the BS stock quickly rebounded and it is currently at record high levels, while the NL stock, despite showing some improvement since the mid-2000s, remains at low levels. Fishing and environmental conditions are known to be important drivers of cod dynamics in both ecosystems, especially the availability of high energy prey like capelin (Mallotus villosus), however, the question of how different or similar these two stocks truly are remains. Could, for example, the NL cod stock rebuild if presented to conditions like the ones experienced by BS cod? To explore such questions, we developed a simple biomass dynamic model for cod using a bioenergetic-allometric approach. This model includes fisheries catches and capelin availability as external drivers and was implemented for both ecosystems. Despite the contrasting trends, the model produced very good fits, and showed some remarkably similar estimated parameters in both systems. We explored these similarities by (a) performing the thought experiment of transferring cod stocks between ecosystems by switching estimated key parameters between models and comparing the output, and (b) implementing an integrated model architecture which allowed fitting common parameters for both stocks to evaluate the similarity of key vital rates. Our results indicate that cod trajectories in NL and BS can be reliably described using simple bioenergetic-allometric arguments, fishery catches, and capelin availability. Model parameters that encapsulate intrinsic vital rates were not significantly different between stocks. This indicates that NL and BS cod stocks are biologically similar, and that the differences in their trajectories are driven by the ecosystem context in which these stocks are embedded, and suggests that the NL stock would be expected to rebuild if enough capelin were available. This also indicates that capelin status and trend should be an important consideration for effective management of these cod stocks.},

We describe the theoretical connection between HGAMs, HGLMs, and GAMs, explain how to model different assumptions about the degree of intergroup variability in functional response, and show how HGAMs can be readily fitted using existing GAM software, the mgcv package in R.

	abstract = {Ecology is often governed by nonlinear dynamics. Nonlinear ecological relationships can include thresholds—incremental changes in drivers that provoke disproportionately large ecological responses. Among the species that experience nonlinear and threshold dynamics are Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.). These culturally, ecologically, and economically significant fishes are in many places declining and management focal points. Often, managers can influence or react to ecological conditions that salmon experience, suggesting that nonlinearities, especially thresholds, may provide opportunities to inform decisions. However, nonlinear dynamics are not always invoked in management decisions involving salmon. Here, we review reported nonlinearities and thresholds in salmon ecology, describe potential applications that scientists and managers could develop to leverage nonlinear dynamics, and offer a path toward decisions that account for ecological nonlinearities and thresholds to improve salmon outcomes. It appears that nonlinear dynamics are not uncommon in salmon ecology and that many management arenas may potentially leverage them to enable more effective or efficient decisions. Indeed, decisions guided by nonlinearities and thresholds may be particularly desirable considering salmon management arenas are often characterized by limited resources and mounting ecological stressors, practical constraints, and conservation challenges. More broadly, many salmon systems are data-rich and there are an extensive range of ecological contexts in which salmon are sensitive to anthropogenic decisions. Approaches developed to leverage nonlinearities in salmon ecology may serve as examples that may inform analogous approaches in other systems and taxa.},

Fisheries collapses provide the best known examples for realizing tipping points with catastrophic ecological, economic and social consequences. However, present-day fisheries management systems still largely ignore the potential of their resources to exhibit such abrupt changes towards irreversible low productive states. Using a combination of statistical changepoint analysis and stochastic cusp modelling, here we show that Western Baltic cod is beyond such a tipping point caused by unsustainable exploitation levels that failed to account for changing environmental conditions. Furthermore, climate change stabilizes a novel and likely irreversible low productivity state of this fish stock that is not adapted to a fast warming environment. We hence argue that ignorance of non-linear resource dynamics has caused the demise of an economically and culturally important social-ecological system which calls for better adaptation of fisheries systems to climate change.},

For small sample sizes especially, likelihood-based inference can be unreliable with variance components being particularly difficult to estimate. A Bayesian approach is appealing but has been hampered by the lack of a fast implementation, and the difficulty in specifying prior distributions with variance components again being particularly problematic. Here, we briefly review previous approaches to computation in Bayesian implementations of GLMMs and illustrate in detail, the use of integrated nested Laplace approximations in this context. We consider a number of examples, carefully specifying prior distributions on meaningful quantities in each case. The examples cover a wide range of data types including those requiring smoothing over time and a relatively complicated spline model for which we examine our prior specification in terms of the implied degrees of freedom. We conclude that Bayesian inference is now practically feasible for GLMMs and provides an attractive alternative to likelihood-based approaches such as penalized quasi-likelihood. As with likelihood-based approaches, great care is required in the analysis of clustered binary data since approximation strategies may be less accurate for such data.},

Some violations have little impact on the results or ecological conclusions; yet others increase type I or type II errors, potentially resulting in wrong ecological conclusions. Most of these violations can be avoided by applying better data exploration. These problems are especially troublesome in applied ecology, where management and policy decisions are often at stake. 3. Here, we provide a protocol for data exploration; discuss current tools to detect outliers, heterogeneity of variance, collinearity, dependence of observations, problems with interactions, double zeros in multivariate analysis, zero inflation in generalized linear modelling, and the correct type of relationships between dependent and independent variables; and provide advice on how to address these problems when they arise. We also address misconceptions about normality, and provide advice on data transformations. 4. Data exploration avoids type I and type II errors, among other problems, thereby reducing the chance of making wrong ecological conclusions and poor recommendations. It is therefore essential for good quality management and policy based on statistical analyses.},

	abstract = {Coral reefs are under threat from disease as climate change alters environmental conditions. Rising temperatures exacerbate coral disease, but this relationship is likely complex as other factors also influence coral disease prevalence. To better understand this relationship, we meta-analytically examined 108 studies for changes in global coral disease over time alongside temperature, expressed using average summer sea surface temperature (SST) and cumulative heat stress as weekly sea surface temperature anomalies (WSSTAs). We found that both rising average summer SST and WSSTA were associated with global increases in the mean and variability in coral disease prevalence. Global coral disease prevalence tripled, reaching 9.92\% in the 25 years examined, and the effect of ‘year’ became more stable (i.e. prevalence has lower variance over time), contrasting the effects of the two temperature stressors. Regional patterns diverged over time and differed in response to average summer SST. Our model predicted that, under the same trajectory, 76.8\% of corals would be diseased globally by 2100, even assuming moderate average summer SST and WSSTA. These results highlight the need for urgent action to mitigate coral disease. Mitigating the impact of rising ocean temperatures on coral disease is a complex challenge requiring global discussion and further study.},

In this context, “omics” technologies, by allowing the simultaneous measurement of numerous biological endpoints, could help unravel the in situ toxicity of contaminants. In this study, wild Atlantic eels were sampled in 8 sites presenting a broad contamination gradient in France and Canada. The global hepatic transcriptome of animals was determined by RNA-Seq. In parallel, the contamination level of fish to 8 metals and 25 organic pollutants was determined. Factor analysis for multiple testing was used to identify genes that are most likely to be related to a single factor. Among the variables analyzed, arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), lindane (γ-HCH) and the hepato-somatic index (HSI) were found to be the main factors affecting eel’s transcriptome. Genes associated with As exposure were involved in the mechanisms that have been described during As vasculotoxicity in mammals. Genes correlated with Cd were involved in cell cycle and energy metabolism. For γ-HCH, genes were involved in lipolysis and cell growth. Genes associated with HSI were involved in protein, lipid and iron metabolisms. Our study proposes specific gene signatures of pollutants and their impacts in fish exposed to multi-stress conditions.},

This is particularly true of fishes for which research has been motivated by their ecological importance, socioeconomic value, and increased use as model species for medical and genetic research. Here, we review studies that have used RNA-seq to study transcriptomic responses to continuous abiotic variables to which fishes have likely evolved a response and that are predicted to be affected by climate change (e.g., salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, and pH). Field and laboratory experiments demonstrate the potential for individuals to respond plastically to short- and long-term environmental stress and reveal molecular mechanisms underlying developmental and transgenerational plasticity, as well as adaptation to different environmental regimes.

	abstract = {Thermal stress, encountered frequently in aquaculture, affects diverse physiological processes and behavior of fish; however, the mechanism underlying these effects may vary among species. Half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis) widely inhabits Asian coastal waters and has been intensively cultured in China. In this study, the transcriptomes of three tissues (gill, liver and muscle) of half-smooth tongue sole stressed at temperatures up to 35°C were profiled and compared with those of the fish living at a normal temperature of 25°C. Of 105,228 transcripts, 23,213 were annotated in GO terms, and 718, 1236 and 561 were found to express differentially in gill, liver and muscle from control, respectively. Of the differentially expressed genes, 119 were shared by all three tissues. Tissue-overlapping transcripts and the pathways and functions they defined may underline the primary response of fish to thermostressing. High temperature may cause directly protein mis-folding and hypoxia. Cells suffering thermostress either survive hypoxia or are eliminated by immune system. High temperature may have interacted indirectly through HSPs with HIF-1 and JAKs/STATs signaling pathways. The former up-regulates the expression of hypoxia inducible genes while the later up-regulates the expression of genes associating with insulin and NOD-like receptors signaling pathways. Insulin pathway functions to sustain homeostasis of sugar and lipids, aiding to survive cells, while NOD-like receptors signaling pathway strengthens immune, apoptotic and inflammatory responses, helping to survive cells. These understandings may help improve our culturing practice, the culture performance of half-smooth tongue sole and its breeding.},

	abstract = {Climate change and associated increases in water temperatures may impact physiological performance in ectotherms and exacerbate endangered species declines. We used an integrative approach to assess the impact of elevated water temperature on two fishes of immediate conservation concern in a large estuary system, the threatened longfin smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys) and endangered delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus). Abundances have reached record lows in California, USA, and these populations are at imminent risk of extirpation. California is currently impacted by a severe drought, resulting in high water temperatures, conditions that will become more common as a result of climate change. We exposed fish to environmentally relevant temperatures (14°C and 20°C) and used RNA sequencing to examine the transcriptome-wide responses to elevated water temperature in both species. Consistent with having a lower temperature tolerance, longfin smelt exhibited a pronounced cellular stress response, with an upregulation of heat shock proteins, after exposure to 20°C that was not observed in delta smelt. We detected an increase in metabolic rate in delta smelt at 20°C and increased expression of genes involved in metabolic processes and protein synthesis, patterns not observed in longfin smelt. Through examination of responses across multiple levels of biological organization, and by linking these responses to habitat distributions in the wild, we demonstrate that longfin smelt may be more susceptible than delta smelt to increases in temperatures, and they have little room to tolerate future warming in California. Understanding the species-specific physiological responses of sensitive species to environmental stressors is crucial for conservation efforts and managing aquatic systems globally.},

In particular, the integration of transcriptomics with physiological and ecological research is increasingly playing an important role in identifying functional physiological thresholds predictive of compensatory responses and detrimental outcomes, transforming the way we can study issues in conservation biology. Notably, with technological advances in RNA sequencing, transcriptome-wide approaches can now be applied to species where no prior genomic sequence information is available to develop species-specific tools and investigate sublethal impacts that can contribute to population declines over generations and undermine prospects for long-term conservation success. Here, we examine the use of transcriptomics as a means of determining organismal responses to environmental stressors and use key study examples of conservation concern in fishes to highlight the added value of transcriptome-wide data to the identification of functional response pathways. Finally, we discuss the gaps between the core science and policy frameworks and how thresholds identified through transcriptomic evaluations provide evidence that can be more readily used by resource managers.},

Molecular techniques have been increasingly used to study responses of wild organisms to environmental and anthropogenic stressors. The present study used transcriptomics to examine the physiology of wild-caught walleye (Sander vitreus (Mitchell, 1818)) across Lake Winnipeg using non-lethal techniques. Gill transcriptomes of walleye sampled from the north and south basins of Lake Winnipeg, and the channel connecting them, exhibited distinct profiles implicating regionally specific biological responses. North basin walleye exhibited transcriptomic responses indicative of exposure to environmental stressors. Transcriptomic patterns suggested a shift to increased reliance on anaerobic metabolism and up-regulation of hypoxia-sensitive genes in north basin fish, possibly representing exposure to low-oxygen conditions. Exposure to environmental stressors may also have driven increases in gene transcripts associated with proteasomal catabolism, DNA repair, molecular chaperones, and ion regulation. North basin fish also exhibited transcriptomic patterns indicative of gill remodeling via regulation of the mTOR pathway, cytoskeleton reorganization, and fatty acid synthesis. Our results highlight the complexity of examining wild fish across environmental gradients but also the potential use of molecular techniques in elucidating organismal sensitivity to local environmental factors.},

	abstract = {Thriving freshwater fish populations contribute to people’s economic prosperity and wellbeing. Yet, freshwater fish populations are in critical condition around the globe. Most stressors to freshwater fishes, fisheries, and culture stem from habitat impacts, water-quality issues, and aquatic invasive species. Logistical difficulties of monitoring fish health are compounded by the limitations of conventional (capture-based) sampling methods, which provide only a temporal “snapshot” and generate data lacking in sensitivity and prognostic ability. Here, we propose an innovative genomics approach to develop a health toolkit that will allow resource-sector users to determine the health status of freshwater fishes, including their coping capacity, to environmental stressors. The stress-response transcription profile (STP)-chip is a suite of quantitative gene transcription assays that represents key gene pathways broadly associated with fish functional responses to environmental stress; therefore, the differential expression of well-selected genes can provide sensitive fish-health status indicators. Despite the scientific achievement of using genomics tools, actualizing the toolkit in practice is only successful if resource-sector users have full buy-in. We present seven case studies representing different practitioners and resource users – Indigenous rightsholders, environmental consultants (industry), commercial aquaculture, environmental charities (ENGO), and fishery commissions and managers (government) where each explores the benefits and risks associated with the adoption of a genomics fish-health toolkit. Using a co-production approach, wherein practitioners and resource users are engaged from the outset, these case studies reveal translational pathways that would be needed to overcome barriers to technological adoption and, hence, accelerate the responsible uptake of genomics-based applications in fisheries assessment, management, and conservation.},

Even though most recreationally angled fish are released, little is known about how C\&amp;R angling impacts fish at the cellular or tissue level. As the first to explore the impacts of C\&amp;R angling on mRNA abundances, our study aimed to identify how the stress of angling influenced metabolism, acid–base regulation and cellular stress in the gills of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush). Because gills are responsible for metabolic gas exchange, are crucial sites of acid–base homeostasis and respond to stressors quickly, we hypothesized that the relative mRNA abundance of genes related to these three physiological processes would be altered after angling. We took gill samples of live lake trout at 0, 2 or 48 h after fish were angled by rod and reel, and then used quantitative PCR (qPCR) to measure the relative abundance of nine candidate mRNA transcripts. Heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) mRNA levels significantly increased over 5-fold 2 h after angling, indicating a potential activation of a cytoprotective response. However, contrary to our hypothesis, we observed no change in the relative mRNA abundance of genes related to metabolism or acid–base regulation in response to C\&amp;R angling within a 48-h period. As C\&amp;R angling can negatively impact fish populations, further use of transcript-level studies will allow us to understand the impact C\&amp;R has on specific tissues and improve our knowledge of how C\&amp;R influences overall fish health.},

Water temperatures greater than 18 °C have occurred almost annually in the Yukon River and correspond with low population abundance since the 1990s. Using gene transcription products and heat shock protein 70 biomarkers validated by field experiment, we identified heat stress in half of Chinook salmon examined (54\%, n = 477) across three mainstem locations and three tributaries in 2016–2017. Biomarkers tracked wide variation in water temperature (14–23 °C) within a tributary. The proportion of salmon with heat stress differed between years at four of the six locations, with more prevalent heat stress in the warmer year.

Water temperatures in the Yukon River and tributaries often exceed 18°C, a threshold commonly associated with heat stress and elevated mortality in Pacific salmon. Untangling the complex web of direct and indirect physiological effects of heat stress on salmon is difficult in a natural setting with innumerable system challenges but is necessary to increase our understanding of both lethal and sublethal impacts of heat stress on populations. The goal of this study was to characterize the cellular stress response in multiple Chinook salmon tissues after acute elevated temperature challenges. We conducted a controlled 4-hour temperature exposure (control, 18°C and 21°C) experiment on the bank of the Yukon River followed by gene expression (GE) profiling using a 3′-Tag-RNA-Seq protocol. The full transcriptome was analysed for 22 Chinook salmon in muscle, gill and liver tissue. Both the 21°C and 18°C treatments induced greater activity in genes associated with protein folding (e.g. HSP70, HSP90 mRNA) processes in all tissues. Global GE patterns indicate that transcriptomic responses to heat stress were highly tissue-specific, underscoring the importance of analyzing multiple tissues for determination of physiological effect. Primary superclusters (i.e. groupings of loosely related terms) of altered biological processes were identified in each tissue type, including regulation of DNA damage response (gill), regulation by host of viral transcription (liver) and regulation of the force of heart contraction (muscle) in the 21°C treatment. This study provides insight into mechanisms potentially affecting adult Chinook salmon as they encounter warm water during their spawning migration in the Yukon River and suggests that both basic and more specialized cellular functions may be disrupted.},

	abstract = {There is growing recognition of the need to understand the mechanisms underlying organismal resilience (i.e. tolerance, acclimatization) to environmental change to support the conservation management of sensitive and economically important species. Here, we discuss how functional genomics can be used in conservation biology to provide a cellular-level understanding of organismal responses to environmental conditions. In particular, the integration of transcriptomics with physiological and ecological research is increasingly playing an important role in identifying functional physiological thresholds predictive of compensatory responses and detrimental outcomes, transforming the way we can study issues in conservation biology. Notably, with technological advances in RNA sequencing, transcriptome-wide approaches can now be applied to species where no prior genomic sequence information is available to develop species-specific tools and investigate sublethal impacts that can contribute to population declines over generations and undermine prospects for long-term conservation success. Here, we examine the use of transcriptomics as a means of determining organismal responses to environmental stressors and use key study examples of conservation concern in fishes to highlight the added value of transcriptome-wide data to the identification of functional response pathways. Finally, we discuss the gaps between the core science and policy frameworks and how thresholds identified through transcriptomic evaluations provide evidence that can be more readily used by resource managers.},

	abstract = {Understanding whether small populations with low genetic diversity can respond to rapid environmental change via phenotypic plasticity is an outstanding research question in biology. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has recently provided the opportunity to examine variation in gene expression, a surrogate for phenotypic variation, in nonmodel species. We used a comparative RNA-seq approach to assess expression variation within and among adaptively divergent populations of a threatened freshwater fish, Nannoperca australis, found across a steep hydroclimatic gradient in the Murray–Darling Basin, Australia. These populations evolved under contrasting selective environments (e.g., dry/hot lowland; wet/cold upland) and represent opposite ends of the species’ spectrum of genetic diversity and population size. We tested the hypothesis that environmental variation among isolated populations has driven the evolution of divergent expression at ecologically important genes using differential expression (DE) analysis and an anova-based comparative phylogenetic expression variance and evolution model framework based on 27,425 de novo assembled transcripts. Additionally, we tested whether gene expression variance within populations was correlated with levels of standing genetic diversity. We identified 290 DE candidate transcripts, 33 transcripts with evidence for high expression plasticity, and 50 candidates for divergent selection on gene expression after accounting for phylogenetic structure. Variance in gene expression appeared unrelated to levels of genetic diversity. Functional annotation of the candidate transcripts revealed that variation in water quality is an important factor influencing expression variation for N. australis. Our findings suggest that gene expression variation can contribute to the evolutionary potential of small populations.},

Morphometric results indicated that fish from the downstream LSP showed lower body condition compared to LSF and LSL. Liver transcriptomic responses were assessed by RNA-sequencing. Two hundred and eighty genes were over-transcribed in LSP perch while 200 genes were under-transcribed compared to LSF and LSL. In LSP fish, genes transcripts related to reproduction, retinol, iron, thyroid hormones, oxidative stress, lipid metabolism and immune functions were among the most abundant suggesting that multiple metabolic and physiological pathways were impacted by environmental stressors at this site. Inhibition of liver superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione S-transferase activities were also observed at the cellular level. Overall, identified impacted biological pathways in perch from LSP may help understand the precarious state of this population and identify the factors inhibiting its recovery.},

However, current salinization research predominantly focuses on mortality endpoints in limited model species, overlooking the sublethal effects on a broader spectrum of organisms and the exploration of adaptive mechanisms and pathways under natural field conditions. To address these gaps, we conducted high-throughput sequencing transcriptomic analysis on the gill tissue of the euryhaline fish Gasterosteus aculeatus, investigating its molecular response to salinity stress in the highly urbanized river Boye, Germany. We found that in stream sections with sublethal concentrations of chloride costly osmoregulatory systems were activated, evidenced by the differential expression of genes related to osmoregulation. Our enrichment analysis revealed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to transmembrane transport and regulation of transport and other osmoregulation pathways, which aligns with the crucial role of these pathways in maintaining biological homeostasis. Notably, we identified candidate genes involved in increased osmoregulatory activity under salinity stress, including those responsible for moving ions across membranes: ion channels, ion pumps, and ion transporters. Particularly, genes from the solute carrier family SLC, aquaporin AQP1, chloride channel CLC7, ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCE1, and ATPases member ATAD2 exhibited prominent differential expression. These findings provide insights into the potential molecular mechanisms underlying the adaptive response of euryhaline fish to salinity stress and have implications for their conservation and management in the face of freshwater salinization.},

With the imminent threat of their movement into the Great Lakes, the goal of the present study was to assess whether differences in the physiological status between silver carp at the leading edge of their invasion front and core population sites could explain their lack of expansion upstream toward Lake Michigan over the past decade. A transcriptomic approach using RNA sequencing and analysis of plasma variables were used to quantify differences among fish at the leading edge and two downstream core population sites. Leading-edge fish exhibited upregulation of genes associated with xenobiotic defense (e.g., ATP-binding cassette C1 [abcc1], abcc2, abcc6), decreased cell integrity (i.e., macroautophagy and apoptosis; autophagy-related protein 9A [atg9a], caspase 3b [casp3b]), and cholesterol metabolism (e.g., abca1, apolipoprotein A1 [apoa1], sterol O-acyltransferase [soat1]) and downregulation of genes associated with DNA repair (e.g., tumor suppressor p53-binding protein 1 [tp53bp1]) compared to core population sites. Transcriptomic profiles of leading-edge fish were consistent with fish inhabiting a polluted environment and suggest that poorer water quality conditions upstream of the leading edge may represent a non-permanent barrier to silver carp range expansion. The present study provides potential molecular targets for monitoring the physiological status of silver carp over time and in response to future improvements in water quality upstream of their leading edge.},

Here, using an equation-free modelling approach on monthly plankton community data in ten Swiss lakes, we show that the number and strength of plankton community interactions fluctuate and respond nonlinearly to water temperature and phosphorus. While lakes show system-specific responses, warming generally reduces network interactions, particularly under high phosphate levels. This network reorganization shifts trophic control of food webs, leading to consumers being controlled by resources. Small grazers and cyanobacteria emerge as sensitive indicators of changes in plankton networks. By exposing the outcomes of a complex interplay between environmental drivers, our results provide tools for studying and advancing our understanding of how climate change impacts entire ecological communities.},

While many reports have been written on physiological or population-level influences of temperature in terms of the decline of wild salmon, synthesis of these diverse sources is needed for evaluation of numeric temperature criteria and their potential in salmon recovery planning. Various sensitive life stages and biological processes are impacted differently for different salmon species. This article reviews the literature for chinook, coho, chum, and steelhead, which are currently listed in the Columbia River Basin under the Endangered Species Act. Spawning, incubation and early fry development, juvenile rearing and growth, smoltification, and migration are considered. Swimming speed, disease susceptibility, chemical considerations, and lethality are also reviewed. Regional population growth and climate change will exacerbate the difficulties of recovering Northwestern salmon beyond remnant runs. Ethical analysis of the assumptions underlying recovery policy decisions, proposals for regime-based water quality standards, and a systems level vulnerability analysis are components of the recovery planning discussions. Specific numeric maximum temperature criteria that can be integrated into a broader recovery planning process are described for sensitive life stages of three species of Pacific Northwest salmon and steelhead.},

	abstract = {Climate change studies have long focused on effects of increasing temperatures, often without considering other simultaneously occurring environmental changes, such as browning of waters. Resolving how the combination of warming and browning of aquatic ecosystems affects fish biomass production is essential for future ecosystem functioning, fisheries, and food security. In this study, we analyzed individual- and population-level fish data from 52 temperate and boreal lakes in Northern Europe, covering large gradients in water temperature and color (absorbance, 420 nm). We show that fish (Eurasian perch, Perca fluviatilis) biomass production decreased with both high water temperatures and brown water color, being lowest in warm and brown lakes. However, while both high temperature and brown water decreased fish biomass production, the mechanisms behind the decrease differed: temperature affected the fish biomass production mainly through a decrease in population standing stock biomass, and through shifts in size- and age-distributions toward a higher proportion of young and small individuals in warm lakes; brown water color, on the other hand, mainly influenced fish biomass production through negative effects on individual body growth and length-at-age. In addition to these findings, we observed that the effects of temperature and brown water color on individual-level processes varied over ontogeny. Body growth only responded positively to higher temperatures among young perch, and brown water color had a stronger negative effect on body growth of old than on young individuals. Thus, to better understand and predict future fish biomass production, it is necessary to integrate both individual- and population-level responses and to acknowledge within-species variation. Our results suggest that global climate change, leading to browner and warmer waters, may negatively affect fish biomass production, and this effect may be stronger than caused by increased temperature or water color alone.},

	abstract = {1. Meta-analysis is a powerful and informative tool for basic and applied research. It provides a statistical framework for synthesizing and comparing the results of studies which have all tested a particular hypothesis. Meta-analysis has the potential to be particularly useful for ecologists and evolutionary biologists, as individual experiments often rely on small sample sizes due to the constraints of time and manpower, and therefore have low statistical power. 2. The rewards of conducting a meta-analysis can be significant. It can be the basis of a systematic review of a topic that provides a powerful exploration of key hypotheses or theoretical assumptions, thereby influencing the future development of a field of research. Alternatively, for the applied scientist, it can provide robust answers to questions of ecological, medical or economic significance. However, planning and conducting a meta-analysis can be a daunting prospect and the analysis itself is invariably demanding and labour intensive. Errors or omissions made at the planning stage can create weeks of extra work. 3. While a range of useful resources is available to help the budding meta-analyst on his or her way, much of the key information and explanation is spread across different articles and textbooks. In order to help the reader use the available information as efficiently as possible (and so avoid making time-consuming errors) this article aims to provide a ‘road map’ to the existing literature. It provides a brief guide to planning, organizing and implementing a meta-analysis which focuses more on logic and implementation than on maths; it is intended to be a first port of call for those interested in the topic and should be used in conjunction with the more detailed books and articles referenced. In the main, references are cited and discussed with an emphasis on useful reading order rather than a chronological history of meta-analysis and its uses. 4. No prior knowledge of meta-analysis is assumed in the current article, though it is assumed that the reader is familiar with anova and regression-type statistical models.},

	abstract = {Anaesthetics are widely used in aquaculture as a method of stress relief. However, few studies have reported the influence of anaesthetics on the immune system of fish. Therefore, in the present study, we selected two different anaesthetics, MS-222 (100 mg/L) and eugenol (20 mg/L), to anaesthetize crucian carp and analyse the transcriptome. It was found that over 137 million high-quality reads were generated and de novo assembled into a final set of 97,556 unigenes. A total of eight differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to the immune response were co-expressed in the two anaesthetic groups. GO and the KEGG revealed that these genes functioned primarily to enrich antigen processing and presentation pathways, including MHCI, MHCIα, p-MHCIIα, P-MHCIIα, CD74, MHCII antigen and MHCII antigenα. Moreover, LRRFIP2 was found be associated with the immune response. Consistent with the transcriptome findings, qPCR verified the changes in the relative level of expression of these genes. Furthermore, long-term exposure to low concentrations of MS-222 (30 mg/L) and eugenol (8 mg/L) showed an impact on these immune genes. In conclusion, anaesthetics used in high or low concentrations for treatment and transport could affect the immune system in fish species. While eugenol was associated with an earlier activation of immune gene expression, MS-222 exhibited more significant effects on the immune response. These findings improve the understanding of the mechanisms of anaesthetics on immune damage and will be of great value for future studies involving anaesthetic selection and treatment for fish.},

When the concentration of MS-222 was 80 mg/L and 200 mg/L, 179 and 887 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), respectively, were identified in the brain tissue of C. idella. When the concentration of 2-PE was 0.6 mL/L and 1.2 mL/L, 498 and 514 DEGs were identified. The DEGs associated with MS-222 treatment were enriched in immune pathways, lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and various signaling pathways; DEGs associated with 2-PE treatment were enriched in immunity and amino acid metabolism. In total, 304 metabolites were identified using a combination of positive and negative ion modes in mass spectrometry. The common differential metabolites identified in the MS-222 high and low concentration groups were 20-HETE and 12(R)-HETE; the common significant differential metabolite identified in the 2-PE high and low concentration groups was salidroside. In combination with the transcriptomics analysis and metabolomics analysis, the results showed that with the MS-222 and 2-PE concentrations used in this experiment, the metabolism of arachidonic acid in C. idella was inhibited by MS-222, and 2-PE affected the upstream and downstream metabolic pathways of arachidonic acid metabolism, thereby affecting the metabolism of arachidonic acid. Both anesthetics induce sedation by affecting related metabolites that affect stress response and autoimmunity. Metabolomics results showed that neither anesthetic had a significant effect on cortisol expression.},

We tracked the fate of 809 individual coral recruits that settled after a severe bleaching event at Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef. Recruited Acropora corals, first detected in 2020, grew to coral cover levels that were equivalent to global average coral cover within just 2 years. Furthermore, we found that just 11.5 Acropora recruits per square meter were sufficient to reach this cover within 2 years. However, wave exposure, growth form and colony density had a marked effect on recovery rates. Our results underscore the importance of considering natural recovery in management and restoration and highlight how lessons learnt from reef recovery can inform our understanding of recovery dynamics in high-diversity climate-disturbed ecosystems.},

In this meta-analysis, by synthesising the results of 103 studies that were distributed globally and conducted at various spatial scales, we revealed a latitudinal gradient in the detectable assembly processes of vascular plant communities. Variations in plant community composition at low and high latitudes were mainly explained by geographic variables, suggesting that distance decay and dispersal limitations causing spatial aggregation are influential in these regions. In contrast, variation in species composition correlated most strongly with environmental variables at mid-latitudes (20–30°), reflecting the importance of environmental filtering, although this unimodal pattern was not statistically significant. Importantly, our analysis revealed the effects of different spatial scales, such that the correlation with spatial variables was stronger at smaller sampling extents, and environmental variables were more influential at larger sampling extents. We concluded that plant communities are driven by different community assembly processes in distinct biogeographical regions, suggesting that the latitudinal gradient of biodiversity is created by a combination of multiple processes that vary with environmental and species size differences.},

We estimated bryophyte C:N:P ratios and their biogeochemical niches, investigated how elementomes respond to the environment and determined whether they tend to diverge more for coexisting than non-coexisting individuals and species. The median C:N:P was 145:8:1, intermediate between Redfield's ratio for marine plankton and those for vascular plants. Biogeochemical niches were differentiated amongst species and were phylogenetically conserved. Differences in individual and species-specific elementomes increased with coexistence between species.

To assist in stock management and conservation efforts, we generated a chromosome-level genome assembly.

From demographic history modeling, we observed reductions in effective population sizes between 3,750 and 8,000 years ago for several northern sampling sites, which may correspond to bottleneck events during recolonization after glacial retreat.},

The HSP70 biomarker can now be interpreted as lab work would be in a medical or veterinary setting as normal vs. abnormal., Rapid and accelerating warming of salmon habitat has the potential to lower productivity of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus species) populations. Heat stress biomarkers can indicate where warming is most likely affecting fish populations; however, we often lack clear classifications that separate individuals with and without heat stress needed to make these tools operational. We conducted a heat exposure experiment with trials lasting 12 or 36 h using juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) to validate heat stress biomarkers in white muscle. Following habituation to 13°C, individuals were exposed to water temperatures that increased to 15°C, 17°C, 19°C, 21°C or 23°C. Heat shock protein 70 abundance (HSP70 measured by ELISA) and transcription of 13 genes (mRNA measured by qPCR) including three heat shock protein genes (hsp70, hsp90, hsp27) were measured. A distinct heat stress response was apparent by 21°C in juvenile Chinook salmon and 23°C in juvenile coho salmon using HSP70. A threshold for heat stress classification in Chinook salmon of {\textgreater} 2 ng HSP70 mg.1 total protein identified heat stress in 100\% of 21 and 23°C treated individuals compared to 4\% in cooler treatments. For coho salmon, {\textgreater} 3 ng HSP70 mg.1 total protein identified heat stress in 100\% of 23°C treated individuals compared to 4\% in cooler treatments. Transcription from a panel of genes separated individuals between cooler and stressful temperature experiences (≥21°C for Chinook salmon and ≥23°C for coho salmon) with {\textasciitilde} 85\% correct classification. Our findings indicate that juvenile Chinook salmon were more temperature-sensitive than juvenile coho salmon and support the use of a HSP70 threshold sampled from muscle for assessing heat stress in individual wild Pacific salmon with an option for non-lethal biopsies for spawning adults.},

	abstract = {Empirical dynamic modelling (EDM) is becoming an increasingly popular method for understanding the dynamics of ecosystems. It has been applied to laboratory, terrestrial, freshwater and marine systems, used to forecast natural populations and has addressed fundamental ecological questions. Despite its increasing use, we have not found full explanations of EDM in the ecological literature, limiting understanding and reproducibility. Here we expand upon existing work by providing a detailed introduction to EDM. We use three progressively more complex approaches. A short verbal explanation of EDM is then explicitly demonstrated by graphically working through a simple example. We then introduce a full mathematical description of the steps involved. Conceptually, EDM translates a time series of data into a path through a multi-dimensional space, whose axes are lagged values of the time series. A time step is chosen from which to make a prediction. The state of the system at that time step corresponds to a ‘focal point’ in the multi-dimensional space. The set (called the library) of candidate nearest neighbours to the focal point is constructed, to determine the nearest neighbours that are then used to make the prediction. Our mathematical explanation explicitly documents which points in the multi-dimensional space should not be considered as focal points. We suggest a new option for excluding points from the library that may be useful for short-term time series that are often found in ecology. We focus on the core simplex and S-map algorithms of EDM. Our new R package, pbsEDM, enhances understanding (by outputting intermediate calculations), reproduces our results and can be applied to new data. Our work improves the clarity of the inner workings of EDM, a prerequisite for EDM to reach its full potential in ecology and have wide uptake in the provision of advice to managers of natural resources.},

Earth system models’ ability to reproduce extreme ocean temperature statistics has not been tested quantitatively, making the reliability of their future projections of marine heat waves uncertain. We demonstrate that annual maxima of detrended anomalies in daily mean sea surface temperatures (SSTs) over 39 years of global satellite observations are described excellently by the generalized extreme value distribution. If models can reproduce the observed distribution of SST extremes, this increases confidence in their marine heat wave projections. 14 CMIP6 models' historical realizations reproduce the satellite-based distribution and its parameters’ spatial patterns. We find that maximum ocean temperatures will become warmer (by 1.07° ± 0.17°C under 2°C warming and 2.04° ± 0.18°C under 3.2°C warming). These changes are mainly due to mean SST increases, slightly reinforced by SST seasonality increases. Our study quantifies ocean temperature extremes and gives confidence to model projections of marine heat waves.},

The median C:N:P was 145:8:1, intermediate between Redfield's ratio for marine plankton and those for vascular plants. Biogeochemical niches were differentiated amongst species and were phylogenetically conserved. Differences in individual and species-specific elementomes increased with coexistence between species.

	abstract = {Gut microbes shape many aspects of organismal biology, yet how these key bacteria transmit among hosts in natural populations remains poorly understood. Recent work in mammals has emphasized either transmission through social contacts or indirect transmission through environmental contact, but the relative importance of different routes has not been directly assessed. Here we used a novel radio-frequency identification-based tracking system to collect long-term high-resolution data on social relationships, space use and microhabitat in a wild population of mice (Apodemus sylvaticus), while regularly characterizing their gut microbiota with 16S ribosomal RNA profiling. Through probabilistic modelling of the resulting data, we identify positive and statistically distinct signals of social and environmental transmission, captured by social networks and overlap in home ranges, respectively. Strikingly, microorganisms with distinct biological attributes drove these different transmission signals. While the social network effect on microbiota was driven by anaerobic bacteria, the effect of shared space was most influenced by aerotolerant spore-forming bacteria. These findings support the prediction that social contact is important for the transfer of microorganisms with low oxygen tolerance, while those that can tolerate oxygen or form spores may be able to transmit indirectly through the environment. Overall, these results suggest social and environmental transmission routes can spread biologically distinct members of the mammalian gut microbiota.},

While changes in network interactions drastically affect ecosystems, how ecological networks respond to climate change, in particular warming and nutrient supply fluctuations, is largely unknown. Here, using an equation-free modelling approach on monthly plankton community data in ten Swiss lakes, we show that the number and strength of plankton community interactions fluctuate and respond nonlinearly to water temperature and phosphorus. While lakes show system-specific responses, warming generally reduces network interactions, particularly under high phosphate levels. This network reorganization shifts trophic control of food webs, leading to consumers being controlled by resources. Small grazers and cyanobacteria emerge as sensitive indicators of changes in plankton networks. By exposing the outcomes of a complex interplay between environmental drivers, our results provide tools for studying and advancing our understanding of how climate change impacts entire ecological communities.},

Warmer temperatures were associated with lower structural and temporal stability, while biodiversity had no consistent effects on either stability property. While species richness was associated with lower structural stability and higher temporal stability, Simpson diversity was associated with higher temporal stability. The responses of structural stability were linked to disproportionate contributions from two trophic groups (predators and consumers), while the responses of temporal stability were linked both to synchrony of all species within the food web and distinctive contributions from three trophic groups (predators, consumers, and producers). Our results suggest that, in natural ecosystems, warmer temperatures can erode ecosystem stability, while biodiversity changes may not have consistent effects.},

We use a nonparametric, nonlinear approach to quantify these effects on the Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) in the Gulf of California. We show that the effect of fishing pressure and environmental variability are comparable. Furthermore, when predicting total catches, the best models account for both drivers. By using empirical dynamic programming with average environmental conditions, we calculated optimal policies to ensure long-term sustainable fisheries. The first policy, the equilibrium maximum sustainable yield, suggests that the fishery could sustain an annual catch of ∼2.16 × 105 tonnes. The second policy with dynamic optimal effort, reveals that the effort from 2 to 4 years ago impacts the current maximum sustainable effort. Consecutive years of high effort require a reduction to let the stock recover. Our work highlights a new framework that embraces the complex processes that drive fisheries population dynamics yet produces simple and robust advice to ensure long-term sustainable fisheries.},

These ecosystem components not only change over time but also interact with each other. Therefore, investigation of individual relationships may give limited insights into their interdependencies and limit ability to predict future ecosystem states. We address this problem by analyzing long-term (16–39 years) time series data from 10 aquatic ecosystems and using convergent cross mapping (CCM) to quantify the causal networks linking phytoplankton species richness, biomass, and physicochemical factors. We determined that individual quantities (e.g., total species richness or nutrients) were not significant predictors of ecosystem stability (quantified as long-term fluctuation of phytoplankton biomass); rather, the integrated causal pathway in the ecosystem network, composed of the interactions among species richness, nutrient cycling, and phytoplankton biomass, was the best predictor of stability. Furthermore, systems that experienced stronger warming over time had both weakened causal interactions and larger fluctuations. Thus, rather than thinking in terms of separate factors, a more holistic network view, that causally links species richness and the other ecosystem components, is required to understand and predict climate impacts on the temporal stability of aquatic ecosystems.},

The estimated effects were opposite in sign between northern and southern stocks and were quite consistent across stocks within species and areas. Warm anomalies in coastal temperatures were associated with increased survival rates for stocks in Alaska and decreased survival rates in Washington and British Columbia, suggesting that different mechanisms determine survival rates in the two areas. Regional-scale sea surface temperatures (SST, within several hundred kilometres of a stock's ocean entry point) were a much better predictor of survival rates than large-scale climate anomalies associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), suggesting that survival rates are primarily linked to environmental conditions at regional spatial scales.

To address this gap, we assembled a vast database of survival and other data for eight wild populations of threatened Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha). For each population, we evaluated climate impacts at all life stages and modeled future trajectories forced by global climate model projections. Populations rapidly declined in response to increasing sea surface temperatures and other factors across diverse model assumptions and climate scenarios. Strong density dependence limited the number of salmon that survived early life stages, suggesting a potentially efficacious target for conservation effort. Other solutions require a better understanding of the factors that limit survival at sea. We conclude that dramatic increases in smolt survival are needed to overcome the negative impacts of climate change for this threatened species.},

	abstract = {Marine and freshwater ecosystems are increasingly at risk of large and cascading changes from multiple human activities (termed “regime shifts”), which can impact population productivity, resilience, and ecosystem structure. Pacific salmon exhibit persistent and large fluctuations in their population dynamics driven by combinations of intrinsic (e.g., density dependence) and extrinsic factors (e.g., ecosystem changes, species interactions). In recent years, many Pacific salmon have declined due to regime shifts but clear understanding of the processes driving these changes remains elusive. Here, we unpacked the role of density dependence, ecosystem trends, and stochasticity on productivity regimes for a community of five anadromous Pacific salmonids (Steelhead, Coho Salmon, Pink Salmon, Dolly Varden, and Coastal Cutthroat Trout) across a rich 40-year time-series. We used a Bayesian multivariate state-space model to examine whether productivity shifts had similarly occurred across the community and explored marine or freshwater changes associated with those shifts. Overall, we identified three productivity regimes: an early regime (1976–1990), a compensatory regime (1991–2009), and a declining regime (since 2010) where large declines were observed for Steelhead, Dolly Varden, and Cutthroat Trout, intermediate declines in Coho and no change in Pink Salmon. These regime changes were associated with multiple cumulative effects across the salmon life cycle. For example, increased seal densities and ocean competition were associated with lower adult marine survival in Steelhead. Watershed logging also intensified over the past 40 years and was associated with (all else equal) ≥97\% declines in freshwater productivity for Steelhead, Cutthroat, and Coho. For Steelhead, marine and freshwater dynamics played approximately equal roles in explaining trends in total productivity. Collectively, these changing environments limited juvenile production and lowered future adult returns. These results reveal how changes in freshwater and marine environments can jointly shape population dynamics among ecological communities, like Pacific salmon, with cascading consequences to their resilience.},

Environmental DNA approaches are increasingly used for species identification, but cannot provide functional insights. Transcriptomic methods reveal the physiological states of macroorganisms, but are currently species-specific and require tissue sampling or animal sacrifice, making community-wide assessments challenging. Here, we test whether broad functional information (expression level of the transcribed genes) can be harnessed from environmental RNA (eRNA), which includes extra-organismal RNA from macroorganisms along with whole microorganisms. We exposed Daphnia pulex as well as phytoplankton prey and microorganism colonizers to control (20°C) and heat stress (28°C) conditions for 7 days. We sequenced eRNA from tank water (after complete removal of Daphnia) as well as RNA from Daphnia tissue, enabling comparisons of extra-organismal and organismal RNA-based gene expression profiles. Both RNA types detected similar heat stress responses of Daphnia. Using eRNA, we identified 32 Daphnia genes to be differentially expressed following heat stress. Of these, 17 were also differentially expressed and exhibited similar levels of relative expression in organismal RNA. In addition to the extra-organismal Daphnia response, eRNA detected community-wide heat stress responses consisting of distinct functional profiles and 121 differentially expressed genes across eight taxa. Our study demonstrates that environmental transcriptomics based on extra-organismal eRNA can noninvasively reveal gene expression responses of macroorganisms following environmental changes, with broad potential implications for the biomonitoring of health across the trophic chain.},

To bridge this gap, this study introduces a relative quantification method for eRNA, employing quantitative PCR (qPCR) to evaluate the expression of the antioxidant gene, catalase (cat), in the Japanese medaka Oryzias latipes exposed to two toxic chemicals for 96 h: chlorpyrifos (CPS) and carbamazepine. Our results showed that, in eRNA, genes frequently used as a reference for tissue or cells in conventional expression analysis correlated with each other. Also, one of them (elfa) exhibited less variability, showing its potential suitability as a reference gene in eRNA analyses. Additionally, cat expression levels in eRNA increased with increasing CPS concentrations, in a concentration-response manner. These results suggest the promising potential of qPCR applications for eRNA in the monitoring of an organism's health and response to environmental changes. However, we observed disparities in gene expression levels of cat and beta-actin (actb) between eRNA and whole fish body, indicating eRNA might have a biased origin. Further research is needed to uncover the origin of eRNA and determine the limitations and applicability domain of eRNA analysis.},

However, eDNA methods have limited application for estimating population-level metrics. Environmental RNA (eRNA) has the potential to address ecological questions by gathering population demographic information from environmental media but may be challenging to detect and analyze. We developed gene-specific eRNA assays targeting keratin-associated genes in two focal species, American bullfrogs (Lithobates catesbeianus) and tiger salamanders (Ambystoma mavortium) to answer an important question in amphibian management: whether species detections represent breeding populations versus transitory adults. We performed an extensive laboratory validation with amphibians housed across development stages, where we collected 95 and 127 environmental samples for bullfrogs and salamanders, respectively. Both assays were highly specific to the larval stage and amplified with high sensitivity (90\% in bullfrog and 88.4\% in tiger salamander samples). We then applied our validated assays to multiple natural systems. When larvae were present, we found 74.1\% overall detection in bullfrog field samples and 70.8\% and 48.5\% overall detection in field samples from ponds with A. macrodactylum and A. californiense larvae, correlating with eDNA detection rates. When only adults were present, we did not detect larvae-specific eRNA in A. macrodactylum ponds, despite high eDNA detection rates. Although much work is ahead for optimizing assay design, sampling and filtering methods, we demonstrate that eRNA can successfully be used to discern life stages with direct application for ecology and conservation management.},

Initiated in 1970, this pretreatment versus post-treatment case study consists of 5 years of preharvest, 6 years of during-harvest, and now, 34 years of postharvest research. Forty-one percent of the watershed was clearcut from 1976 to 1981. One tributary sub-basin (1.1 km2) was left as an unharvested reference drainage. Riparian treatments varied from clearcuts to a variable-width buffer. Fish population responses to logging have been complex, and specific to species and life stages. Stream warming due partly to riparian harvest increased the growth and survival of juvenile coho salmon and elevated smolt production by 65\% for nearly three decades. These relatively short-term thermal benefits offset the effects of riparian clearcutting which included accelerated bank erosion, streambed scour, loss of stable in-stream wood, and sediment movement downstream. Landslides in 1984 greatly amplified these effects but took more than 20 years to propagate downstream to reduce fish habitat complexity and increase streambed instability and sediment transport over the entire portion inhabited by anadromous salmon. These delayed impacts have surpassed the thermal-related benefits for coho salmon. Fry-to-smolt overwinter survival has declined from a mean of 50\% between 1982 and 2004 to 15\% since 2005. Coho salmon smolt production has consequently been reduced to below prelogging levels. Results show that forestry-related alterations may take decades to fully develop and persist for decades longer without watershed and stream channel restoration.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Marine ecosystems are increasingly recognized as exhibiting the principal hallmarks of complex systems, including the possibility of sudden shifts in state among alternative basins of attraction and both periodic and aperiodic dynamical behavior. Over the last several decades a well-defined theory of complexity has emerged, integrating earlier (and inter-related) concepts based on bifurcation theory, catastrophe theory, and chaos theory. In this review, we trace aspects of the historical development of these ideas and their application to marine systems. The manifestations of nonlinear dynamics in marine ecosystems include regime shifts; mirage correlations in which causally-connected system components can appear to be in-phase, asynchronous, or anti-correlated over different stanzas of time; and related state-dependent behavior in which the response of a focal variable to a driver differs depending on the present state of the system. We describe the analytical underpinnings of each of these dynamical behaviors. Although nonlinear dynamical systems are often portrayed in a deterministic setting, we emphasize the phenomenon of stochastic resonance in which an underlying nonlinear system acts as a noise amplifier in the presence of random perturbations. We next review the tools available for analyzing nonlinear dynamical systems based on the concept of state-space reconstruction and the application of techniques in nonlinear time series analysis. Finally, we address the management implications of nonlinear dynamics in exploited marine species and argue that considerations of predictability and forecast skill can serve as effective criteria for model selection and inference.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

To facilitate new analyses, we developed a new database, the RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database, for commercially exploited marine fishes and invertebrates. Time series of total biomass, spawner biomass, recruits, fishing mortality and catch/landings form the core of the database. Assessments were assembled from 21 national and international management agencies for a total of 331 stocks (295 fish stocks representing 46 families and 36 invertebrate stocks representing 12 families), including nine of the world’s 10 largest fisheries. Stock assessments were available from 27 large marine ecosystems, the Caspian Sea and four High Seas regions, and include the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, Arctic and Antarctic Oceans. Most assessments came from the USA, Europe, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. Assessed marine stocks represent a small proportion of harvested fish taxa (16\%), and an even smaller proportion of marine fish biodiversity (1\%), but provide high-quality data for intensively studied stocks. The database provides new insight into the status of exploited populations: 58\% of stocks with reference points (n = 214) were estimated to be below the biomass resulting in maximum sustainable yield (BMSY) and 30\% had exploitation levels above the exploitation rate resulting in maximum sustainable yield (UMSY). We anticipate that the database will facilitate new research in population dynamics and fishery management, and we encourage further data contributions from stock assessment scientists.},

	abstract = {Environmental variability is a ubiquitous feature of every organism’s habitat. However, the interaction between density dependence and those density‐independent factors that are manifested as environmental noise is poorly understood. We are interested in the conditions under which noise interacts with the density dependence to cause amplification of that noise when filtered by the system. For a broad family of structured population models, we show that amplification occurs near the threshold from stable to unstable dynamics by deriving an analytic formula for the amplification under weak noise. We confirm that the effect of noise is to sustain oscillations that would otherwise decay, and we show that it is the amplitude and not the phase that is affected. This is a feature noted in several recent studies. We study this phenomenon in detail for the Turchin and LPA models of population dynamics. We find that the degree of amplification is sensitive to both the noise input and life‐history stage through which it acts, that the results hold for surprisingly high levels of noise, and that stochastic chaos (as measured by local Lyapunov exponents) is a concomitant feature of amplification. Further, it is shown that the temporal autocorrelation, or “color,” of the noise has a major impact on the system response. We discuss the conditions under which color increases population variance and hence the risk of extinction, and we show that periodicity is sharpened when the color of the noise and dynamics coincide. Otherwise, there is interference, which shows how difficult it is in practice to separate the effects of nonlinearity and noise in short time series. The sensitivity of the population dynamics to noise when close to a bifurcation has wide‐ranging consequences for the evolution and ecology of population dynamics.},

Climatic forcing arose only when susceptible availability was high: temperature and rainfall had net positive and negative effects respectively. By capturing mechanistic, nonlinear and context-dependent effects of population susceptibility, temperature and rainfall on dengue transmission empirically, our model improves forecast skill over recent, state-of-the-art models for dengue incidence. Together, these results provide empirical evidence that the interdependence of host population susceptibility and climate drives dengue dynamics in a nonlinear and complex, yet predictable way.},

In particular, the relationship between recruitment, spawning stock biomass and environmental factors is still poorly understood, even though this aspect is crucial for fisheries management. Fisheries data are often short, but arise from complex dynamical systems with a high degree of stochastic forcing, which are difficult to capture through classic modelling approaches. In the present study, recent statistical approaches based on the approximation of the attractors of dynamical systems are applied on a large dataset of time series to assess (i) the directionality of potential causal relationships between recruitment and spawning stock biomass and potential influence of sea-surface temperature on recruitment and (ii) their performance to forecast recruitment. Our study shows that (i) whereas spawning stock biomass and sea surface temperature influence the recruitment to a lesser extent, recruitment causes also parental stock size and (ii) that non-linear forecasting methods performed well for the short-term predictions of recruitment time series. Our results underline that the complex and stochastic nature of the processes characterizing recruitment are unlikely to be captured by classical stock–recruitment relationships, but that non-linear forecasting methods provide interesting perspectives in that respect.},

Here, we combine the existing techniques of convergent cross mapping (CCM) and dewdrop regression to build a novel test of causal relations that leverages spatial replication, which we call multispatial CCM. Using examples from simulated and real-world ecological data, we test the ability of multispatial CCM to detect causal relationships between processes. We find that multispatial CCM successfully detects causal relationships with as few as five sequential observations, even in the presence of process noise and observation error. Our results suggest that this technique may constitute a useful test for causality in systems where experiments are difficult to perform and long time series are not available.

	abstract = {The population dynamics of forage fish are often ‘boom or bust’, and variation in recruitment may be a contributing factor to changes in abundance. Here we applied several methods for identifying stock recruit relationships (SRR) to 52 forage fish stocks: a time-invariant Ricker model and two time-varying methods (dynamic linear models and regime-based models). A positive relationship between spawning biomass and recruitment existed for 28 stocks, with 14 of those being best fit by a Ricker curve. Time-varying models were preferred for 26 stocks over a time-invariant Ricker curve. We also showed through simulation that spurious, yet significant stock-recruit relationships can be generated if recruitment was environmentally driven, the lag between recruitment and spawning biomass was small, and autocorrelation in recruitment was high—a combination of characteristics that many forage fish stocks display. Based on our results, observed time-invariant SRRs can result from a reversed causality of ‘boom and bust’ dynamics in situations in which life histories are short (i.e., changes in recruitment are driving changes in spawning biomass). ‘Hidden’ SRRs are also possible because of time-variation in SRR parameters. Understanding when each of these potential failings of fitting SRRs can occur is a key challenge in forage fish management.},

	abstract = {Recruitment is the number of young fish entering a population and is an essential process in age-structured stock assessment models. Many of the models on which stock assessments are based assume some level of influence of spawning biomass on recruitment, and estimation of this functional relationship has been a focus of substantial research. However, recruitment is also influenced by environmental fluctuations that induce autocorrelated patterns, trends, and shifts in deviations from the stock-recruitment relationship. Consequently, previous meta-analyses of stock-recruitment relationships have had trouble calibrating the relationship. We revisited the findings of Szuwalski et al. (2015) to determine if their results are robust to the addition of data to the RAM Legacy Stock Assessment database and choice of analysis method (the PELT algorithm, MARSS models, and Bayesian change point detection). Since the publication of Szuwalski et al. (2015), the number of stocks in the database has doubled. We determined the primary influence of spawning biomass on recruitment and examined the recruitment time series for regime shifts for 432 stocks. Our results indicated that 57\% of stocks did not have a significant correlation between spawning biomass and recruitment over the observed biomasses. Environmental conditions played a larger role in recruitment variation than spawning biomass. The presence, location, and number of regime shifts in recruitment time series was highly dependent on the detection method, with Bayesian change point detection identifying the fewest regime shifts. Despite the sensitivity to the detection method, 46\% of stocks without a significant correlation between spawning biomass and recruitment are estimated to have experienced at least one regime shift as determined by the PELT algorithm Our analyses suggest that effective methods for modeling and forecasting large variations in recruitment over time are needed, particularly given that climate change is predicted to impact the frequency and magnitude of regime shifts.},

	abstract = {Objective In a southcentral Alaska stream system, we conducted a study to evaluate the effect of trap type (galvanized and nylon coated), bait type (salmon roe cured with and without sodium sulfite), and soak times (1 h and 24 h) on captures of juvenile salmon using Gee-style minnow traps. This was undertaken due to the limited research on this topic, aiming to determine how variations in methodology affected captures in juvenile salmon. Methods We employed a three-way fixed factorial design to sample 176 stream reaches (with a single trap in each each) from June 2021 to September 2021, capturing 296 Coho Salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch and 105 Chinook Salmon O. tshawytscha. Result We found an estimated 78\% decrease in captures of Coho Salmon when nylon-coated traps were used instead of galvanized traps, and we found that trap type showed no effect on number of captures for Chinook Salmon. Additionally, we did not detect effects of bait type and soak time on the number of captures for either species. Not surprisingly, there was a positive relationship between Julian date and temperature with captures for both species. Additionally, for Coho Salmon, we found a quadratic relationship between water velocity and captures. Conclusion Understanding and accounting for these factors will help researchers to maximize trapping efficiency, standardize protocols, and determine the extent to which results are comparable across studies employing different methods.},

We tracked water temperature in conjunction with young-of-year Coho Salmon size, growth, and diet in 2 streams with contrasting thermal regimes: a groundwater stream with colder temperatures and lower thermal variability all year and a surface-water stream with greater thermal variability and warmer summer temperatures more conducive to young-of-year salmon growth. We hypothesized that fry emergence would occur when rearing conditions are optimal for growth and that, all else being equal, summer fish growth will be greater in the surface-water stream. Previous work on Coho Salmon phenology in these streams showed that peak fry emergence occurred at the same time in early summer in both streams. We measured salmon fry emergence in relation to thermal variability and macroinvertebrate prey availability with subsequent tracking of somatic growth, diet, and body size during the 1st year of life in both streams. Macroinvertebrate prey availability was highest overall in the colder and thermally-stable groundwater stream than the surface-water stream. Prey availability was particularly high in the thalweg drift during peak fry emergence in the groundwater stream. There was no difference in Coho Salmon diet composition between streams, which included invertebrates from benthic, drift, and riparian habitats. We found no differences in young-of-year Coho Salmon body size, growth, or consumption between streams. Overall, our results suggest that large differences in thermal regimes do not necessarily translate to large differences in young-of-year Coho Salmon size, growth, or diet. Many variables can influence fish growth, and there is not always a direct connection between spatial and temporal dimensions of environmental variability and their cascading effects on young-of-year Coho Salmon growth during the 1st summer of life.},

	abstract = {Juvenile Pacific salmon exhibit diverse habitat use and migration strategies to navigate high environmental variability and predation risk during freshwater residency. Increasingly, urbanization and climate-driven hydrological alterations are affecting the availability and quality of aquatic habitats in salmon catchments. Thus, conservation of freshwater habitat integrity has emerged as an important challenge in supporting salmon life-history diversity as a buffer against continuing ecosystem changes. To inform catchment management for salmon, information on the distribution and movement dynamics of juvenile fish throughout the annual seasonal cycle is needed. A number of studies have assessed the ecology of juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) during summer and autumn seasons; catchment use by this species throughout the annual cycle is less well characterized, particularly in high-latitude systems. Here, n = 3,792 tagged juvenile coho salmon were tracked throughout two complete annual cycles to assess basin-wide distribution and movement behaviour of this species in a subarctic, ice-bearing catchment. Juvenile coho salmon in the Big Lake basin, Alaska, exhibited multiple habitat use and movement strategies across seasons; however, summer rearing in lotic mainstem environments followed by migration to lentic overwinter habitats was identified as a prominent behaviour, with two-thirds of tracked fish migrating en masse to concentrate in a small subset of upper catchment lakes for the winter. In contrast, the most significant tributary overwintering site (8\% of tracked fish) occurred below a culvert and dam, blocking juvenile fish passage to a headwater lake, indicating that these fish may have been restricted from reaching preferred lentic overwinter habitats. These findings emphasize the importance of maintaining aquatic connectivity to lentic habitats as a conservation priority for coho salmon during freshwater residency.},

These temporal shifts in community composition determine essential aspects of species interactions and how energy, nutrients, information, diseases and perturbations ‘flow’ through systems. Yet, our understanding of community structure has relied heavily on static analyses not designed to capture critical features of this dynamic temporal dimension of communities. Here, we propose a conceptual and methodological framework for quantifying and analysing this temporal dimension. Conceptually, we split the temporal structure into two definitive features, sequence and duration, and review how they are linked to key concepts in ecology. We then outline how we can capture these definitive features using perspectives and tools from temporal graph theory. We demonstrate how we can easily integrate ongoing research on phenology into this framework and highlight what new opportunities arise from this approach to answer fundamental questions in community ecology. As climate change reshuffles ecological communities worldwide, quantifying the temporal organization of communities is imperative to resolve the fundamental processes that shape natural ecosystems and predict how these systems may change in the future.},

Here we assess the impact of climate change on global river flows and river water temperatures, and identify regions that might become more critical for freshwater ecosystems and water use sectors. We used a global physically based hydrological-water temperature modelling framework forced with an ensemble of bias-corrected general circulation model (GCM) output for both the SRES A2 and B1 emissions scenario. This resulted in global projections of daily river discharge and water temperature under future climate. Our results show an increase in the seasonality of river discharge (both increase in high flow and decrease in low flow) for about one-third of the global land surface area for 2071–2100 relative to 1971–2000. Global mean and high (95th percentile) river water temperatures are projected to increase on average by 0.8–1.6 (1.0–2.2)°C for the SRES B1–A2 scenario for 2071–2100 relative to 1971–2000. The largest water temperature increases are projected for the United States, Europe, eastern China, and parts of southern Africa and Australia. In these regions, the sensitivities are exacerbated by projected decreases in low flows (resulting in a reduced thermal capacity). For strongly seasonal rivers with highest water temperatures during the low flow period, up to 26\% of the increases in high (95th percentile) water temperature can be attributed indirectly to low flow changes, and the largest fraction is attributable directly to increased atmospheric energy input. A combination of large increases in river temperature and decreases in low flows are projected for the southeastern United States, Europe, eastern China, southern Africa and southern Australia. These regions could potentially be affected by increased deterioration of water quality and freshwater habitats, and reduced water available for human uses such as thermoelectric power and drinking water production.},

Nonstationary temperature effects were tested with three different analytical methods (correlation, mixed-effects models, and variable coefficient generalized additive models) applied to spawner–recruit time series from 86 wild runs between Puget Sound and the northern Bering Sea. All three methods supported the hypothesis, with evidence for change in temperature effects that was strongest in the Gulf of Alaska, British Columbia, and Washington and weakest in the Bering Sea. Productivity for all three species showed generally positive responses to ocean temperature in Alaska before 1988–1989, but generally neutral responses after 1988–1989. British Columbia and Washington salmon showed either neutral responses to temperature (pink), negative responses that weakened after 1988–1989 (sockeye), or a switch from neutral to negative responses (chum). We conclude that the inverse response of Alaskan and more southern salmon populations to temperature variability is a time-dependent phenomenon.},

Although most of these changes have important ecological and at times economic implications, they remain notoriously difficult to detect in advance. Here, we study changes in the stability of populations under stress across a variety of transitions. Using a Ricker-type model, we simulate shifts from stable point equilibrium dynamics to cyclic and irregular boom–bust oscillations as well as abrupt shifts between alternative attractors. Our aim is to infer the loss of population stability before such shifts based on changes in nonlinearity of population dynamics. We measure nonlinearity by comparing forecast performance between linear and nonlinear models fitted on reconstructed attractors directly from observed time series. We compare nonlinearity to other suggested leading indicators of instability (variance and autocorrelation). We find that nonlinearity and variance increase in a similar way prior to the shifts. By contrast, autocorrelation is strongly affected by oscillations. Finally, we test these theoretical patterns in datasets of fisheries populations. Our results suggest that elevated nonlinearity could be used as an additional indicator to infer changes in the dynamics of populations under stress.},

	abstract = {The population dynamics of forage fish are often ‘boom or bust’, and variation in recruitment may be a contributing factor to changes in abundance. Here we applied several methods for identifying stock recruit relationships (SRR) to 52 forage fish stocks: a time-invariant Ricker model and two time-varying methods (dynamic linear models and regime-based models). A positive relationship between spawning biomass and recruitment existed for 28 stocks, with 14 of those being best fit by a Ricker curve. Time-varying models were preferred for 26 stocks over a time-invariant Ricker curve. We also showed through simulation that spurious, yet significant stock-recruit relationships can be generated if recruitment was environmentally driven, the lag between recruitment and spawning biomass was small, and autocorrelation in recruitment was high—a combination of characteristics that many forage fish stocks display. Based on our results, observed time-invariant SRRs can result from a reversed causality of ‘boom and bust’ dynamics in situations in which life histories are short (i.e., changes in recruitment are driving changes in spawning biomass). ‘Hidden’ SRRs are also possible because of time-variation in SRR parameters. Understanding when each of these potential failings of fitting SRRs can occur is a key challenge in forage fish management.},

	abstract = {Aquatic systems are warming and exceeding upper thermal limits (UTLs) for many fish species, yet understanding how they inform resilience to climate change is challenging. Using Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) as a model, we conducted a systematic review involving 168 papers investigating UTL in five species. We found considerable variation in UTL among species, within species and across life stages; largely attributed to methodological approaches (e.g. CTmax/UILT, Aerobic/Cardiac Scope, Thermal Migration Barriers, Rearing Mortality, Thermal Preference/Avoidance). Given that each method has strengths and weaknesses owing to logistics, time scale and ecological realism, we offer a new framework for assessing vulnerability to warming that stresses the importance of considering UTL metrics in the context of intended use (i.e. the development of management guidelines, projections of future persistence and survival) and what aspect (physiological or behavioural) of thermal response a metric investigates. Comparing studies with identical UTL approaches revealed that within species, UTL was higher for populations historically encountering higher temperatures—suggesting local thermal adaptation. Within populations, UTL differed across the lifecycle, being highest in fry and lowest in embryo and migrating adults, but this was not universal. For spawning Pacific salmon, UTL has not been assessed and few studies have examined estuarine and marine stages. Ultimately, this data gap limits the life-history thermal perspectives that can be drawn and may indicate a broader gap for all fishes, given that Pacific salmon are among the most well-studied species. Our framework illustrates the inherent and methodological inconsistencies in UTL and offers a guide for how thermal limits can best be used to assess the warming tolerance and vulnerability of fishes.},

	abstract = {In the 12 years since Dudgeon et al. (2006) reviewed major pressures on freshwater ecosystems, the biodiversity crisis in the world's lakes, reservoirs, rivers, streams and wetlands has deepened. While lakes, reservoirs and rivers cover only 2.3\% of the Earth's surface, these ecosystems host at least 9.5\% of the Earth's described animal species. Furthermore, using the World Wide Fund for Nature's Living Planet Index, freshwater population declines (83\% between 1970 and 2014) continue to outpace contemporaneous declines in marine or terrestrial systems. The Anthropocene has brought multiple new and varied threats that disproportionately impact freshwater systems. We document 12 emerging threats to freshwater biodiversity that are either entirely new since 2006 or have since intensified: (i) changing climates; (ii) e-commerce and invasions; (iii) infectious diseases; (iv) harmful algal blooms; (v) expanding hydropower; (vi) emerging contaminants; (vii) engineered nanomaterials; (viii) microplastic pollution; (ix) light and noise; (x) freshwater salinisation; (xi) declining calcium; and (xii) cumulative stressors. Effects are evidenced for amphibians, fishes, invertebrates, microbes, plants, turtles and waterbirds, with potential for ecosystem-level changes through bottom-up and top-down processes. In our highly uncertain future, the net effects of these threats raise serious concerns for freshwater ecosystems. However, we also highlight opportunities for conservation gains as a result of novel management tools (e.g. environmental flows, environmental DNA) and specific conservation-oriented actions (e.g. dam removal, habitat protection policies, managed relocation of species) that have been met with varying levels of success. Moving forward, we advocate hybrid approaches that manage fresh waters as crucial ecosystems for human life support as well as essential hotspots of biodiversity and ecological function. Efforts to reverse global trends in freshwater degradation now depend on bridging an immense gap between the aspirations of conservation biologists and the accelerating rate of species endangerment.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenically induced global climate change has profound implications for marine ecosystems and the economic and social systems that depend upon them. The relationship between temperature and individual performance is reasonably well understood, and much climate-related research has focused on potential shifts in distribution and abundance driven directly by temperature. However, recent work has revealed that both abiotic changes and biological responses in the ocean will be substantially more complex. For example, changes in ocean chemistry may be more important than changes in temperature for the performance and survival of many organisms. Ocean circulation, which drives larval transport, will also change, with important consequences for population dynamics. Furthermore, climatic impacts on one or a few ‘leverage species’ may result in sweeping community-level changes. Finally, synergistic effects between climate and other anthropogenic variables, particularly fishing pressure, will likely exacerbate climate-induced changes. Efforts to manage and conserve living marine systems in the face of climate change will require improvements to the existing predictive framework. Key directions for future research include identifying key demographic transitions that influence population dynamics, predicting changes in the community-level impacts of ecologically dominant species, incorporating populations’ ability to evolve (adapt), and understanding the scales over which climate will change and living systems will respond.},

In this study, populations of wild-caught adult pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) and sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka) salmon from the Fraser River, British Columbia, Canada, were experimentally treated to ecologically relevant ‘cool’ or ‘warm’ water temperatures to uncover common transcriptomic responses to elevated water temperature in non-lethally sampled gill tissue. We detected the differential expression of 49 microarray features (29 unique annotated genes and one gene with unknown function) associated with protein folding, protein synthesis, metabolism, oxidative stress and ion transport that were common between populations and species of Pacific salmon held at 19°C compared with fish held at a cooler temperature (13 or 14°C). There was higher mortality in fish held at 19°C, which suggests a possible relationship between a temperature-induced CSR and mortality in these species. Our results suggest that frequently encountered water temperatures ≥19°C, which are capable of inducing a common CSR across species and populations, may increase risk of upstream spawning migration failure for pink and sockeye salmon.},

	abstract = {Fishes respond to different abiotic and biotic stressors through changes in gene expression as a part of an integrated physiological response. Transcriptomics approaches have been used to quantify gene expression patterns as a reductionist approach to understand responses to environmental stressors in animal physiology and have become more commonly used to study wild fishes. We argue that non-lethal sampling for transcriptomics should become the norm for assessing the physiological status of wild fishes, especially when there are conservation implications. Processes at the level of the transcriptome provide a “snapshot” of the cellular conditions at a given time; however, by using a non-lethal sampling protocol, researchers can connect the transcriptome profile with fitness-relevant ecological endpoints such as reproduction, movement patterns and survival. Furthermore, telemetry is a widely used approach in fisheries to understand movement patterns in the wild, and when combined with transcriptional profiling, provides arguably the most powerful use of non-lethal sampling for transcriptomics in wild fishes. In this review, we discuss the different tissues that can be successfully incorporated into non-lethal sampling strategies, which is particularly useful in the context of the emerging field of conservation transcriptomics. We briefly describe different methods for transcriptional profiling in fishes from high-throughput qPCR to whole transcriptome approaches. Further, we discuss strategies and the limitations of using transcriptomics for non-lethally studying fishes. Lastly, as ‘omics’ technology continues to advance, transcriptomics paired with different omics approaches to study wild fishes will provide insight into the factors that regulate phenotypic variation and the physiological responses to changing environmental conditions in the future.},

Here, we discuss how functional genomics can be used in conservation biology to provide a cellular-level understanding of organismal responses to environmental conditions. In particular, the integration of transcriptomics with physiological and ecological research is increasingly playing an important role in identifying functional physiological thresholds predictive of compensatory responses and detrimental outcomes, transforming the way we can study issues in conservation biology. Notably, with technological advances in RNA sequencing, transcriptome-wide approaches can now be applied to species where no prior genomic sequence information is available to develop species-specific tools and investigate sublethal impacts that can contribute to population declines over generations and undermine prospects for long-term conservation success. Here, we examine the use of transcriptomics as a means of determining organismal responses to environmental stressors and use key study examples of conservation concern in fishes to highlight the added value of transcriptome-wide data to the identification of functional response pathways. Finally, we discuss the gaps between the core science and policy frameworks and how thresholds identified through transcriptomic evaluations provide evidence that can be more readily used by resource managers.},

Clinical manifestations of these diseases often indicate a considerable advancement in the pathological process. Infected fish often experience morbidity, leading to compromised welfare and substantial economic losses for production facilities. Therefore, prophylaxis and early detection of the pathogens could allow the facility managers to intervene or treat the disease before clinical disease signs occur. For the first time, environmental DNA/RNA (collectively eNA) was used to detect the salmonid pathogen Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida in the water hosting rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). This took place under controlled experimental conditions, before the occurrence of clinical outcome and mortality. The concentration of bacteria in the water was determined by using a standard curve. To determine the window of possible intervention, bacterial concentration was measured from an early stage of disease and throughout when fish became moribund. Furthermore, the acute phase protein, serum amyloid A produced by rainbow trout, was detected in the water and was found to be up-regulated 4 days post challenge. It was thereby shown that it is possible to detect strong immune responses in the fish in a non-invasive manner. The detection of eNA from the water can be used as a tool to detect pathogens in the early phase of infection before the disease becomes severe. This will facilitate interventions to limit the disease and increase the welfare of the fish, which is becoming a requirement for a more sustainable and ethical animal production.},

This Review summarizes methods that apply and integrate omics tools to experimentally investigate, monitor and predict how species and communities in the wild cope with global climate change, which is by genetically adapting to new environmental conditions, through range shifts or through phenotypic plasticity.

Various methods have been proposed to detect regime shifts from time series data, but a generic detection method with theoretical linkage to underlying dynamics is lacking. Here, we provide a novel method named Nested-Library Analysis (NLA) to retrospectively detect regime shifts using empirical dynamic modeling (EDM) rooted in theory of attractor reconstruction. Specifically, NLA determines the time of regime shift as the cutting point at which sequential reduction of the library set (i.e., the time series data used to reconstruct the attractor for forecasting) optimizes the forecast skill of EDM. We illustrate this method on a chaotic model of which changing parameters present a critical transition. Our analysis shows that NLA detects the change point in the model system and outperforms existing approaches based on statistical characteristics. In addition, NLA empirically detected a real-world regime shift event revealing an abrupt change of Pacific Decadal Oscillation index around the mid-1970s. Importantly, our method can be easily generalized to various systems because NLA is equation-free and requires only a single time series.},

	abstract = {There is a growing trend in the natural sciences to view time series as products of dynamical systems. This viewpoint has proven to be particularly useful in stimulating debate and insight into the nature of the underlying generating mechanisms. Here I review some of the issues concerning the use of forecasting in the detection of nonlinearities and possible chaos, particularly with regard to stochastic chaos. Moreover, it is shown how recent attempts to measure meaningful Lyapunov exponents for ecological data are fundamentally flawed, and that when observational noise is convolved with process noise, computing Lyapunov exponents for the real system will be difficult. Such problems pave the way for more operational definitions of dynamic complexity (cf. Yao \& Tong, this volume) . Aside from its use in the characterization of chaos, nonlinear forecasting can be used more broadly in pragmatic classification problems. Here I review a recent example of nonlinear forecasting as it is applied to classify human heart rhythms. In particular, it is shown how forecast nonlinearity can be a good discriminator of the physiological effects of age, and how prediction-decay may discriminate heartdisease. In so doing, I introduce a method for characterizing nonlinearity using ‘S-maps’ and a method for analysing multiple short time series with composite attractors.},

	abstract = {Coral reefs are under threat from disease as climate change alters environmental conditions. Rising temperatures exacerbate coral disease, but this relationship is likely complex as other factors also influence coral disease prevalence. To better understand this relationship, we meta-analytically examined 108 studies for changes in global coral disease over time alongside temperature, expressed using average summer sea surface temperature (SST) and cumulative heat stress as weekly sea surface temperature anomalies (WSSTAs). We found that both rising average summer SST and WSSTA were associated with global increases in the mean and variability in coral disease prevalence. Global coral disease prevalence tripled, reaching 9.92\% in the 25 years examined, and the effect of ‘year’ became more stable (i.e. prevalence has lower variance over time), contrasting the effects of the two temperature stressors. Regional patterns diverged over time and differed in response to average summer SST. Our model predicted that, under the same trajectory, 76.8\% of corals would be diseased globally by 2100, even assuming moderate average summer SST and WSSTA. These results highlight the need for urgent action to mitigate coral disease. Mitigating the impact of rising ocean temperatures on coral disease is a complex challenge requiring global discussion and further study.},

	abstract = {Understanding the function of the human microbiome is important but the development of statistical methods specifically for the microbial gene expression (i.e. metatranscriptomics) is in its infancy. Many currently employed differential expression analysis methods have been designed for different data types and have not been evaluated in metatranscriptomics settings. To address this gap, we undertook a comprehensive evaluation and benchmarking of 10 differential analysis methods for metatranscriptomics data. We used a combination of real and simulated data to evaluate performance (i.e. type I error, false discovery rate and sensitivity) of the following methods: log-normal (LN), logistic-beta (LB), MAST, DESeq2, metagenomeSeq, ANCOM-BC, LEfSe, ALDEx2, Kruskal–Wallis and two-part Kruskal–Wallis. The simulation was informed by supragingival biofilm microbiome data from 300 preschool-age children enrolled in a study of childhood dental disease (early childhood caries, ECC), whereas validations were sought in two additional datasets from the ECC study and an inflammatory bowel disease study. The LB test showed the highest sensitivity in both small and large samples and reasonably controlled type I error. Contrarily, MAST was hampered by inflated type I error. Upon application of the LN and LB tests in the ECC study, we found that genes C8PHV7 and C8PEV7, harbored by the lactate-producing Campylobacter gracilis, had the strongest association with childhood dental disease. This comprehensive model evaluation offers practical guidance for selection of appropriate methods for rigorous analyses of differential expression in metatranscriptomics. Selection of an optimal method increases the possibility of detecting true signals while minimizing the chance of claiming false ones.},

Such alternative attractors, as for example equilibria and cycles, have been found in the dynamics of experimental systems. Yet, for natural systems, where multiple biotic and abiotic factors simultaneously affect population dynamics, it is more challenging to distinguish alternative dynamical behaviors. Although recent research exemplifies that some natural systems can exhibit alternative states, a robust methodology for testing whether these constitute distinct dynamical attractors is currently lacking. Here, using attractor reconstruction techniques we develop such a test. Applications of the methodology to simulated, experimental and natural time series data, reveal that alternative dynamical behaviors are hard to distinguish if population dynamics are governed by purely stochastic processes. However, if population dynamics are brought about also by mechanisms internal to the system, alternative attractors can readily be detected. Since many natural populations display evidence of such internally driven dynamics, our approach offers a method for empirically testing whether ecosystems exhibit alternative dynamical attractors.},

	abstract = {Populations of animals comprise many individuals, interacting in multiple contexts, and displaying heterogeneous behaviors. The interactions among individuals can often create population dynamics that are fundamentally deterministic yet display unpredictable dynamics. Animal populations can, therefore, be thought of as complex systems. Complex systems display properties such as nonlinearity and uncertainty and show emergent properties that cannot be explained by a simple sum of the interacting components. Any system where entities compete, cooperate, or interfere with one another may possess such qualities, making animal populations similar on many levels to complex systems. Some fields are already embracing elements of complexity to help understand the dynamics of animal populations, but a wider application of complexity science in ecology and evolution has not occurred. We review here how approaches from complexity science could be applied to the study of the interactions and behavior of individuals within animal populations and highlight how this way of thinking can enhance our understanding of population dynamics in animals. We focus on 8 key characteristics of complex systems: hierarchy, heterogeneity, self-organization, openness, adaptation, memory, nonlinearity, and uncertainty. For each topic we discuss how concepts from complexity theory are applicable in animal populations and emphasize the unique insights they provide. We finish by outlining outstanding questions or predictions to be evaluated using behavioral and ecological data. Our goal throughout this article is to familiarize animal ecologists with the basics of each of these concepts and highlight the new perspectives that they could bring to variety of subfields.},

However, in the last 2 decades, fields as diverse as physics, ecology, neurobiology, and economics have recognized that many complicated systems have emergent and self-organized properties that cannot be explained as the linear sum of components, but instead must be viewed as the potentially diverse outcomes of system nonlinearity. Despite some pioneering efforts to apply complexity theory to group movements and decision making, most behavioral ecologists have avoided invoking complexity perspectives in their research. In this essay, we argue that the reductionist focus on dyads in our field has largely run its course and that the next frontier is to examine whether and how social and communication networks function as complex nonlinear systems. To this end, we provide a sampling of topics within behavioral ecology where we think complexity theory may be illuminating.},

Recently, all types of nonlinear dynamics were shown for experimental communities where several species interact. Yet, there are no data exhibiting the whole range of nonlinear dynamics for single-species systems without trophic interactions. Up until now, ecological experiments and models ignored the intracellular dimension, which includes multiple nonlinear processes even within one cell type. Here, we show that dynamics of single-species systems of protists in continuous experimental chemostat systems and corresponding continuous-time models reveal typical characteristics of nonlinear dynamics and even deterministic chaos, a very rare discovery. An automatic cell registration enabled a continuous and undisturbed analysis of dynamic behavior with a high temporal resolution. Our simple and general model considering the cell cycle exhibits a remarkable spectrum of dynamic behavior. Chaos-like dynamics were shown in continuous single-species populations in experimental and modeling data on the level of a single type of cells without any external forcing. This study demonstrates how complex processes occurring in single cells influence dynamics on the population level. Nonlinearity should be considered as an important phenomenon in cell biology and single-species dynamics and also, for the maintenance of high biodiversity in nature, a prerequisite for nature conservation.},

We use empirical dynamic modeling—an approach based on state-space reconstruction rather than correlation—to demonstrate causal effects of those factors on population spatial variability. The causal effects are detected in most study species, though direction and strength vary. Specifically, truncated age structure elevates population spatial variability. Warming and spatially heterogeneous temperatures may enhance population spatial variability, whereas abundance and large-scale environmental effects are inconclusive. Fishing may affect population spatial variability directly or indirectly by altering age structure or abundance.

Recent discussions concerning ecosystem “regime shifts” again raise the question of whether population fluctuations are mainly controlled by external forcing. Results of nonlinear time series analyses indicate that pelagic populations typically do not passively track stochastic environmental variables. Rather, population dynamics are better described as nonlinear amplification of physical forcing by biological interactions. However, we illustrate that in some cases populations do show linear tracking of the physical environment. To explain why population dynamics can sometimes be linear, we propose the linear tracking window hypothesis: populations are most likely to track the stochastic environmental forcing when their generation time matches the characteristic time scale of the environmental signal. While our observations follow this hypothesis well, our results indicate that the linear tracking window is a necessary but not a sufficient condition.},

Exploited populations are commonly recognized to exhibit complex population dynamics, which often affect the harvest of economic and culturally important species. How social learning, harvest, and population diversity shape population dynamics are not well understood, and I therefore undertook studies to investigate their effects. (1) I developed novel theory to assess the population dynamic consequences of migratory homing acquired via social learning, called the adopted migrant life history. Simple mechanistic assumptions led to dynamical behaviours ranging from stable coexistence of local populations to local extirpations, depending on the encounter potential between dispersing juveniles and migrating adults. Local populations were especially vulnerable under unequal adult survival, suggesting that uneven harvest pressure could exacerbate the risk of local collapses that are difficult to reverse. (2) I verified that harvest can increase temporal variability in the abundance of exploited populations by analyzing a harvest experiment on Daphnia magna. Harvest elevated population variability by amplifying deterministic nonlinear dynamics rather than increasing the effect of environmental stochasticity alone. This implies high short-term predictability but also the possibilities of oscillations, tipping points, and hysteresis. (3) I identified a large contraction in Pacific herring spawning phenology between 1951 and 2016 in British Columbia, Canada. Herring are a vital forage fish in northeast Pacific food webs, and support fisheries both directly and indirectly. The contraction represents a type of population diversity loss, which may impact population stability via erosion of portfolio effects. My results show the dynamic consequences of social learning and harvest, and identify a population diversity decline in an important forage fish. Together these results open a new perspective on complex population dynamics in exploited populations.},

We conducted a factorial experiment on the population dynamics of Daphnia magna in relation to size-selective harvesting and stochasticity of food supply. Harvesting and stochasticity treatments both increased population fluctuations. Timeseries analysis indicated that fluctuations in control populations were non-linear, and non-linearity increased substantially in response to harvesting. Both harvesting and stochasticity induced population juvenescence, but harvesting did so via the depletion of adults, whereas stochasticity increased the abundance of juveniles. A fitted fisheries model indicated that harvesting shifted populations towards higher reproductive rates and larger-magnitude damped oscillations that amplify demographic noise. These findings provide experimental evidence that harvesting increases the non-linearity of population fluctuations and that both harvesting and stochasticity increase population variability and juvenescence.},

	abstract = {The identification of key environmental forcings responsible for population patterns is a pervasive ecological problem and an important application of time series analysis. A common approach, implemented with methods such as cross-correlation and cross-spectral analysis, relies on matching scales of variability. This approach concludes that a population pattern is caused by a physical factor if their variances share a dominant period. In a nonlinear system, however, forcing at one temporal period can produce a response with variability at one or more different periods. Thus, scale-matching methods will be most successful at establishing cause–effect relationships in linear systems, or close to equilibria, where nonlinear systems are well approximated by linear ones. Here, we propose an alternative approach that does not assume linearity and relies on time series models that are both nonlinear and nonparametric. We specifically apply these models to determine the correct but unknown frequency of a periodic forcing. The time series are generated by simulation of a predator–prey model. Under periodic forcing, this type of model is known to be capable of different dynamic regimes, including chaos and quasiperiodicity, in which the power spectra of population numbers exhibit variance at frequencies other than that of the forcing. We show that nonlinear time series models, built with feedforward neural networks, are able to distinguish the correct forcing period in the predator–prey simulations. These results hold under two common limitations of ecological data: the presence of dynamical and measurement noise, and the availability of time series data for only one variable. We discuss future applications of the approach to more general environmental forcings, other than periodic.},

While crucial in predicting biological processes, discovering general relations for such nonlinear dynamics has remained a challenge. Here, we derive a universal information-theoretical constraint on a broad class of nonlinear dynamical systems represented as population dynamics. The constraint is interpreted as a generalization of Fisher’s fundamental theorem of natural selection. Furthermore, the constraint indicates nontrivial bounds for the speed of critical relaxation around bifurcation points, which we argue are universally determined only by the type of bifurcation. Our theory is verified for an evolutionary model and an epidemiological model, which exhibit the transcritical bifurcation, as well as for an ecological model, which undergoes limit-cycle oscillation. This work paves a way to predict biological dynamics in light of information theory, by providing fundamental relations in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics of nonlinear systems.},

	abstract = {Aerobic scope (AS) has been proposed as a functional measurement that can be used to make predictions about the thermal niche of aquatic ectotherms and hence potential fitness outcomes under future warming scenarios. Some salmonid species and populations, for example, have been reported to exhibit different thermal profiles for their AS curves such that AS peaks around the modal river temperature encountered during the upriver spawning migration, suggesting species- and population-level adaptations to river temperature regimes. Interestingly, some other salmonid species and populations have been reported to exhibit AS curves that maintain an upwards trajectory throughout the ecologically relevant temperature range rather than peaking at a modal temperature. To shed further light on this apparent dichotomy, we used adult coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) to test the prediction that peak AS coincides with population-specific, historically experienced river temperatures. We assessed AS at 10 and 15°C, which represent a typical river migration temperature and the upper limit of the historically experienced temperature range, respectively. We also examined published data on AS in juvenile coho salmon in relation to new temperature data measured from their freshwater rearing environments. In both cases, AS was either maintained or increased modestly throughout the range of ecologically relevant temperatures. In light of existing evidence and the new data presented here, we suggest that when attempting to understand thermal optima for Pacific salmon and other species across life stages, AS is a useful metric of oxygen transport capacity but other thermally sensitive physiological indices of performance and fitness should be considered in concert.},

	abstract = {Aquatic systems are warming and exceeding upper thermal limits (UTLs) for many fish species, yet understanding how they inform resilience to climate change is challenging. Using Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) as a model, we conducted a systematic review involving 168 papers investigating UTL in five species. We found considerable variation in UTL among species, within species and across life stages; largely attributed to methodological approaches (e.g. CTmax/UILT, Aerobic/Cardiac Scope, Thermal Migration Barriers, Rearing Mortality, Thermal Preference/Avoidance). Given that each method has strengths and weaknesses owing to logistics, time scale and ecological realism, we offer a new framework for assessing vulnerability to warming that stresses the importance of considering UTL metrics in the context of intended use (i.e. the development of management guidelines, projections of future persistence and survival) and what aspect (physiological or behavioural) of thermal response a metric investigates. Comparing studies with identical UTL approaches revealed that within species, UTL was higher for populations historically encountering higher temperatures—suggesting local thermal adaptation. Within populations, UTL differed across the lifecycle, being highest in fry and lowest in embryo and migrating adults, but this was not universal. For spawning Pacific salmon, UTL has not been assessed and few studies have examined estuarine and marine stages. Ultimately, this data gap limits the life-history thermal perspectives that can be drawn and may indicate a broader gap for all fishes, given that Pacific salmon are among the most well-studied species. Our framework illustrates the inherent and methodological inconsistencies in UTL and offers a guide for how thermal limits can best be used to assess the warming tolerance and vulnerability of fishes.},

Ten case studies from North America illustrate how changes in climate can lead to rapid, threshold-type responses within ecological communities; the case studies also highlight the role of human activities that alter the rate or direction of system response to climate change. Understanding and anticipating nonlinear dynamics are important aspects of adaptation planning since responses of biological resources to changes in the physical climate system are not necessarily proportional and sometimes, as in the case of complex ecological systems, inherently nonlinear.},

The demise of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) stocks constitutes a text book example of the consequences of overexploiting marine living resources, yet the drivers of these nearly synchronous collapses are still debated. Moreover, it is still unclear why rebuilding of collapsed fish stocks such as cod is often slow or absent. Here, we apply the stochastic cusp model, based on catastrophe theory, and show that collapse and recovery of cod stocks are potentially driven by the specific interaction between exploitation pressure and environmental drivers. Our statistical modelling study demonstrates that for most of the cod stocks, ocean warming could induce a nonlinear discontinuous relationship between fishing pressure and stock size, which would explain hysteresis in their response to reduced exploitation pressure. Our study suggests further that a continuing increase in ocean temperatures will probably limit productivity and hence future fishing opportunities for most cod stocks of the Atlantic Ocean. Moreover, our study contributes to the ongoing discussion on the importance of climate and fishing effects on commercially exploited fish stocks, highlighting the importance of considering discontinuous dynamics in holistic ecosystem-based management approaches, particularly under climate change.},
